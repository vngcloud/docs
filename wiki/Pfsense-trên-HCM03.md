An open-source security solution with a custom kernel based on FreeBSD OS. [pfSense](https://www.pfsense.org/) is one of the leading network firewalls with a commercial level of features.

pfSense is available as a hardware device, virtual appliance, and downloadable binary (community edition).

I like their extensive [documentation](https://docs.netgate.com/pfsense/en/latest/index.html), well explained, and easy to follow. On a high-level, some of the worth mentioning pfSense features are:


*  **Firewall**  – IP/port filtering, limiting connections, layer two capable, scrubbing
*  **State table**  – by default all rules are stateful, multiple configurations available for state handling,
*  **Server load balancing**  – inbuilt LB to [distribute the load](https://geekflare.com/open-source-load-balancer/) between multiple backend servers
*  **NAT**  (Network address translation) – port forwarding, reflection
*  **HA**  (High-availability) – failover to secondary if primary fail
*  **Multi-WAN**  (wide area network) – use more than one internet connection.
*  **VPN**  (a virtual private network) – support IPsec and OpenVPN
*  **Reporting**  – Keep historical resources utilization information
*  **Monitoring**  – real-time monitoring
*  **Dynamic DNS**  – multiple DNS clients are included
*  **DHCP**  &  **Relay**  ready

More than some of the commercial firewall features you get in FREE.

Amazing, isn’t it?

Not only that, but you also have an option to install packages with just one click.

Ex:


*  **Security**  – a stunner, snort, tinc, [nmap](https://geekflare.com/port-scanner-server/), arpwatch
*  **Monitoring**  – iftop, ntopng, softflowd, urlsnarf, darkstat, mailreport
*  **Networking**  – netio, nut, Avahi
*  **Routing**  – frr, olsrd, routed, OpenBGPD
*  **Services**  – iperf, widentd, syslog-ng, bind, acme, imspector, git, dns-server

pfSense looks promising and worth giving a try. Check out [Kamatera](https://go.cloudwm.com/visit/?bta=35166&nci=5445) if looking for pfSense hosting.
