# Service accounts

Service Account is an identity that you can create under your Root User account and has specific permissions. It has some similarities with IAM User Account. To clarify, Service Account and IAM User Account are both identities with permission policies that define what that identity can and cannot do with VNG Cloud resources. However, Service Account is used by an application or machine, not a person, to make authorized API calls and access specified resources.

Trusted Relationships are a feature that allows for permissions to be shared between different Root User Accounts, allowing for customized and secure access authorizations on separate administrative entities. With this feature, different Root User Accounts can collaborate while maintaining privacy and security boundaries. This feature is especially useful in situations where multiple organizations or teams need to work together on shared resources, ensuring effective collaboration without sacrificing security.
