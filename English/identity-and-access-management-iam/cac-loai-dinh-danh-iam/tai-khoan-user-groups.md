# User Groups

**Managing User Groups**&#x20;

An IAM User Group is a collection of IAM User Accounts. IAM User Groups simplify permissions management by allowing you to grant, change, and remove permissions to multiple IAM User Accounts at once. For example, you can create an IAM User Group called "Administrators" and grant administrative permissions to that group. Any IAM User Account in the group automatically has the permissions assigned to the group.

**How to create an IAM User Group?**&#x20;

To create a new IAM User Group:&#x20;

1. Go to IAM Console: https://iam.console.vngcloud.vn/&#x20;
2. Click "Group" in the left menu.&#x20;
3. Click "Create a group".&#x20;
4. Provide a group name and optional description.&#x20;
5. Assign relevant IAM Policies to the group to define the group's permissions.
6. Review the settings and click "Create group".

5. By default, you will see the "Permission" tab on the IAM User Group details page.&#x20;
6. Click the "Attach Policies" button, then you will see a window appear containing all Policies.&#x20;
7. Search for the Policies you want to assign by typing the exact name of the Policies in the search box.&#x20;
8. Select the Policies you want to assign from the search results and click the "Attach" button in the lower right corner of the popup.&#x20;
9. Now, your IAM User Group will have all the permissions contained in the assigned Policies and ensure that all IAM User Accounts in the Groups inherit all these Permissions.

**Note**

*   Remember that once you confirm deletion of an IAM User Group, that Group cannot be restored.

    Review and assign new Policies to the IAM User Accounts that belong to the deleted IAM User Groups, to ensure that the IAM User Accounts continue to function properly.
