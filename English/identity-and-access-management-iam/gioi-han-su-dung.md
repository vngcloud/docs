# Limitation

In VNG Cloud's IAM (Identity and Access Management) system, there are some restrictions on the number of IAM objects that can be used in the system. These restrictions are set to ensure efficient resource allocation and prevent overuse or overconsumption of resources. These restrictions will vary depending on the object being used. Here are some key points to introduce these restrictions:

* Access to IAM Console to see Quota & Limitation at here: [https://hcm-3.console.vngcloud.vn/iam/quotas](https://hcm-3.console.vngcloud.vn/iam/quotas)

#### List of IAM Limitation <a href="#quota-and-limitation-danhsachiamlimitation" id="quota-and-limitation-danhsachiamlimitation"></a>

By default, IAM VNG Cloud Service will set limits for the attributes as below:

<table><thead><tr><th width="203">Name</th><th width="142">Current Limit</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>User Account</td><td>20</td><td>Number of IAM User Accounts can belong to a Root User</td></tr><tr><td>Group</td><td>20</td><td>Number of User Groups can belong to a Root User</td></tr><tr><td>Service Account</td><td>20</td><td>Number of Service Accounts can belong to a Root User</td></tr><tr><td>Policy</td><td>20</td><td>Number of Policies can belong to a Root User</td></tr><tr><td>Identity Provider</td><td>5</td><td>Number of Identity Providers can belong to a Root User</td></tr></tbody></table>

#### Change the IAM Limitation <a href="#quota-and-limitation-thaydoiiamlimitation" id="quota-and-limitation-thaydoiiamlimitation"></a>

Currently, IAM Console does not support users to adjust these limit attributes themselves. In case there is a need to change, users can proactively create a ticket for further support here:[https://support.vngcloud.vn/#/app/dashboard](https://support.vngcloud.vn/#/app/dashboard)
