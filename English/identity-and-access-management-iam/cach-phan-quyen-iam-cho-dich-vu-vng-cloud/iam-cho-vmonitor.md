# IAM for vMonitor

IAM is essential to protecting resources within vMonitor services. Without proper access control, unauthorized users can access sensitive data or disrupt critical operations. IAM helps enforce the principle of least privilege, minimizing potential attack surfaces and protecting your server resources from unauthorized access and data compromise.

### 1. Getting Started with IAM&#x20;

This guide is intended to guide users to quickly get started with IAM in vMonitor services by using the default permission (defined by VNG Cloud Managed Policies) for the vMonitor system called vStorageFullAccess.

1. Accessing the IAM Console&#x20;

* Open your web browser and access the IAM Console URL: https://hcm-3.console.vngcloud.vn/iam/
* Log in as a Root User Account or a User Account with access rights. You will need to provide a username/email and password when logging in.&#x20;
* After logging in, you will see the IAM Console interface, which provides an overview of your IAM configuration.

2. Create a new IAM User Account&#x20;

* Click "Create user" in the left menu
* Click "Create a user account."&#x20;
* Enter the user account details, including username and password.&#x20;
* Review the settings and click "Create user account" in the upper right corner.

3. Access the vMonitor Portal with the IAM User Account&#x20;

* Open your web browser and go to the vMonitor website URL: [https://console.vstorage.vngcloud.vn/ ](https://vmonitor.console.vngcloud.vn/)
* Remember to log out of the Root User account and log in with the IAM User Account created in step 2.&#x20;
* After logging in, you will see an overview of the vMonitor website.&#x20;
* Try to access the Network, Server, Bock store, Load balancer, Container & Billing pages, you will see a notification about limited permissions as below.

Notice

* The IAM User Account created in Step 2 does not currently have permissions to perform actions on the vMonitor cloud service.&#x20;

* Once logged in, you will see the IAM Console interface, which provides an overview of your IAM configuration.&#x20;
* Click on "User account" in the left menu.
* Search for an IAM user account by entering the username in the search box.&#x20;
* Click on the row containing the IAM user account information in the search results.&#x20;
* By default, you will see the "Permission" tab on the IAM user account details page.&#x20;
* Click on the "Attach policies" button and then you will see a dialog box appear containing all the Policies.&#x20;
* Search for the vMonitorFullAccess policy by entering its exact name in the search box.&#x20;
