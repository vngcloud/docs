# vCloudstack

### Overview <a href="#tong-quan" id="tong-quan"></a>

vCloudStack is a managed solution that delivers VNG Cloud infrastructure and services to virtually any on-premises location. The vCloudStack solution allows you to scale your infrastructure deployment and run VNG Cloud services on-premises.

Therefore, this solution is very suitable for businesses that already own existing infrastructure and are familiar with using cloud computing services, which can be reused to virtualize infrastructure devices with vCloudstack.

With vCloudStack, you can run several VNG Cloud services locally and connect to many services available in VNG Cloud regions. This is a hybrid environment, providing high flexibility, while maintaining control and security of sensitive data.
