# Certificate in vCloudstack

VNG Cloud provides Certificate Manager, allowing users to upload and manage their certificates. We support the management of 2 main types of certificates:

* **TLS/SSL Certificate**
* **CA Certificate**

**1. TLS/SSL Certificate:**

* **A TLS/SSL Certificate** is a digital document containing information about a website or server's public key and authentication credentials. They are used to establish a secure connection between a user's computer and a web server, ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of data transmitted over the network.
* **What TLS/SSL Certificates Do:** TLS/SSL certificates ensure that information such as passwords, personal data, and financial transactions are encrypted and protected against security threats. They also verify the authenticity of the web server, letting users know they are visiting the right website and not a fake one.
* **TLS/SSL Certificate Types:** There are many types of TLS/SSL certificates, including free certificates, self-signed certificates, and certificates issued by a certificate authority (CA).

**2. CA (Certificate Authority) Certificate:**

* **A Certificate Authority (CA)** is an organization or company responsible for issuing, validating, and managing TLS/SSL Certificates. A CA is a trusted party that verifies and ensures the authenticity of entities requesting TLS/SSL Certificates.
* **Function of CA Certificate:** CA Certificate authenticates the identity of websites and servers by signing and issuing TLS/SSL Certificates. It ensures that the information in the TLS/SSL Certificate is authentic and secure.
* **Characteristics of CA Certificates:** Major CAs are widely trusted and recognized by web browsers and computer systems. When a website uses a TLS/SSL Certificate issued by a CA, the browser displays a padlock icon or authenticates the website, creating trust for users.
