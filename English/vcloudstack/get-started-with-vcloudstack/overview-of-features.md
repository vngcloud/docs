### Overview <a href="#tong-quan" id="tong-quan"></a>

vCloudStack is a hybrid cloud service designed to manage and extend VNG Cloud's infrastructure, services, and APIs to customers' premises. By providing local access to VNG Cloud's managed infrastructure, vCloudStack allows customers to build and operate on-premises applications using the same programming interfaces as in VNG Cloud, while using local resources and storage to reduce latency and meet local data processing needs.

Therefore, vCloudStack has the same basic features and characteristics as the service features that VNG Cloud's vServer is providing.
