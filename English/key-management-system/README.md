# Key Management System

VNG Cloud KMS helps users manage keys securely and efficiently. VNG Cloud supports users with two types of keys:

* VNG Cloud Managed Key: Keys automatically created by VNG Cloud upon request when users utilize VNG Cloud services, completely free of charge. Users can only view the key details.
* Customer Managed Key: Keys created or imported by users in VNG Cloud's KMS system. Users can change the status of the keys or delete them when they are no longer needed.
