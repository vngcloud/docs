# Key Management System

GreenNode KMS helps users manage keys securely and efficiently. GreenNode supports users with two types of keys:

* GreenNode Managed Key: Keys automatically created by GreenNode upon request when users utilize GreenNode services, completely free of charge. Users can only view the key details.
* Customer Managed Key: Keys created or imported by users in GreenNode's KMS system. Users can change the status of the keys or delete them when they are no longer needed.
