# What is vMonitor Platform Synthetic?

vMonitor Platform Synthetic (also known as Synthetic Monitoring) is a tool that checks the performance of servers, websites, or applications 24/7. The assessment results of Synthetic Monitoring help administrators understand the operational capabilities and performance of servers, websites, or applications. From this, administrators can understand the behavior and experience of users with your product or service. With vMonitor Platform Synthetic, you can:

* Proactively monitor server, website, and application availability and performance: Through a 24/7 web/application monitoring dashboard, administrators can continuously check if their services are available. For any anomalies, the system will immediately alert administrators so they can promptly address the issue.
* Reduce Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR): The dashboard will provide important and necessary metrics for administrators to assess incidents, including response time and network timing.
* Monitor servers, web/apps in all environments, including private environments: For businesses with high network security requirements, Synthetic Monitoring allows the installation of a Synthetic private worker (an application set up within the enterprise infrastructure) to monitor internal infrastructures and applications.
* Achieve performance goals: Most organizations have Service Level Objectives (SLOs) or other standards that they expect their applications to meet. Synthetic Monitoring allows you to continuously track whether you are meeting those goals and identify where deviations are occurring, helping you to make appropriate adjustments.
