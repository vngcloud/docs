# Announcement and Instructions on Switching Packages on the vMonitor Platform

### Overview <a href="#thongbaovahuongdanvecachchuyendoigoitrenhethongvmonitorplatform-tongquan" id="thongbaovahuongdanvecachchuyendoigoitrenhethongvmonitorplatform-tongquan"></a>

Starting from **February 29, 2024**, the vMonitor Platform system will change the way resources are purchased to be more flexible to meet the diverse needs of customers. Specifically, instead of choosing from the available service packages (packages) that we provide, you can choose your own resource configuration according to your needs. In addition, you can also purchase multiple types of resources at the same time on the vMonitor Platform system.

From now until **April 22, 2024**, if you have at least 1 Metric Quota resource, Log Project on the vMonitor Platform system, please switch according to our instructions below. After this time, if you have not switched resources, the vMonitor Platform system will automatically switch. Here are a few notes...

* **Step 5:** We provide a comparison table showing the changes when performing the conversion. You can go through each section including: **Metric Quota, Log Project, Paid SMS Notification, Paid Email Notification, Synthetic Test Quota** to view the detailed parameters of each service package before proceeding with the conversion. You need to confirm the conversion information and select **Convert.**

The package conversion process will occur immediately. The Quota/Usage parameters will be preserved after you perform the conversion. At this time, the screen will display the new package format as follows:

In this example, I purchased the Metric Quota package. The Log Project incurs additional charges, so when converted, I automatically received an additional 200 SMS and 200 Email credits free for 6 months. Details:
