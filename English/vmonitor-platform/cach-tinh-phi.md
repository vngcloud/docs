# Pricing

Currently we are supporting 2 types of users: prepaid and postpaid. When you create a Metric Quota, Log project, Notification Quota, Synthetic Monitoring Quota you need to choose a package, we support you to change the quota of the package to a certain value.

* Initially, when you successfully register for a VNG Cloud account, by default we classify you as a prepaid user. That means you need to pay for the package before you can use the service and the package will have a term depending on the cycle you choose.
* If you have a need and ensure a few conditions regarding spending indicators, we can support converting users from prepaid to postpaid. That means you do not need to pay when purchasing the package, the monthly bill value will be calculated based on the actual capacity you use.

You can choose the appropriate form to optimize your or your unit's storage costs. For more details, refer to: [Managing invoices, costs & resources on VNG Cloud](https://docs-vngcloud-vn.translate.goog/vng-cloud-document/v/vn/quan-ly-hoa-don-chi-phi-and-tai-nguyen-tren-vng-cloud) .
