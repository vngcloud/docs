# Access Permissions Security

To ensure secure access to metrics and logs data on vMonitor Platform, we are using a decentralized solution called **Identity and Access Management (IAM)** service . **Identity and Access Management (IAM)** service is an effective decentralization solution to ensure secure access to data on VNG Cloud in general and vMonitor Platform in particular. By using IAM, businesses can ensure that only users with the necessary permissions can access their data. This helps protect data from unauthorized access.

Here are some specific benefits of using IAM to secure data on vMonitor Platform:

* **Help ensure that only users with the necessary permissions can access data:** IAM allows businesses to create and manage access policies for each vMonitor Platform resource. This helps ensure that only users who need to access specific data have access.
* **Help prevent unauthorized access to data:** IAM provides strong authentication and authorization features to help prevent unauthorized access to data.
* **Helps minimize data breach risk:** By using IAM, businesses can minimize data breach risk. IAM helps protect data from unauthorized access, which could lead to a data breach.
