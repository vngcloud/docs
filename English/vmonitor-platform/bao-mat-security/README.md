# Security

Security in vMonitor Platform applications is about ensuring your data and resources are protected from potential threats.

We are currently providing a number of features to help you protect metrics and logs data that you store and use on the vMonitor Platform system, including:

* **Secure access permissions:** VNG Cloud uses IAM to manage user access to vMonitor Platform resources. IAM allows businesses to create and manage access policies for each resource desired by users. This helps ensure that only those with the necessary permissions can access the data.
* **Secure data in transit:** VNG Cloud uses HTTPS to encrypt data in transit. HTTPS is an HTTP-based security protocol that uses TLS/SSL encryption to protect data during transmission.
