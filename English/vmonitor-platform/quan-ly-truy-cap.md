## Manage vMonitor Platform access accounts <a href="#quan-ly-tai-khoan-truy-cap-vmonitor-platform" id="quan-ly-tai-khoan-truy-cap-vmonitor-platform"></a>

You can use 3 types of accounts to access vMonitor Platform. Details of these 3 types include:

* **Root user account: The** [first initial](https://register.vngcloud.vn/signup) account to access VNG Cloud with full access to all resource services on VNG Cloud.
* **IAM user account (User account):** An account created from a single Root user account with access rights depending on the access permission policy set from the Root user account.
* **Service account:** Account used by an application/machine, making authorized API calls and accessing specified resources on VNG Cloud.

Before you can use the two types of **IAM user accounts** and **Service Accounts** , you need to follow these steps:

* Create an IAM user account/ Service Account.
* Initialize policy
* Link the policy to the IAM user account/ Service Account.
