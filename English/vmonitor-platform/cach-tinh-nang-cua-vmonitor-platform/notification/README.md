# Notification

Currently, we support 5 common notification platforms including:

* Email
* SMS
* Slack
* Telegram
* Webhook

For each **Metric quota** and **Log project** package, we offer a specific number of notifications within the package configuration. Email and SMS alerts have quantity limits. If you need more notifications than your package includes, please purchase additional notification packages as instructed in Working with SMS Notification Quota and Working with Email Notification Quota. For alerts via Slack, Telegram, and Webhook, there is no limit on the number of notifications sent by VNG Cloud. However, there might be limitations imposed by providers like Slack, Telegram, and Webhook when sending too many messages to these providers.
