# Working with Synthetic API Test

Synthetic API Test helps you proactively monitor your most important services so they are available anytime and anywhere. API Test supports monitoring of your services using many different protocols including:

* **HTTP(s)** : helps you test websites or services running with HTTP(s)
* **TCP** : helps you test services running TCP
* **Ping** : helps you check servers or devices with Ping

If your service is down or responding slower than you expected, API Test can alert you with channels that Notification supports such as Email, SMS, Slack or Telegram.
