# Working with Synthetic Test Quota

A Synthetic test quota is a term on vMonitor Platform that represents a monitoring package via API with a specific number of API tests and alarms that you purchase on GreenNode. You can only own one Synthetic test quota at a time and use them as a way to organize resources for groups or departments to use for different purposes.
