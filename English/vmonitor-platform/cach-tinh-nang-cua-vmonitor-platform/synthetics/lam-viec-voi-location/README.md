# Working with Location

Location is the place where API Tests will run to your endpoint (URL, hostname). There are 2 types of Location: Public Location and Private Location with the following characteristics:

* Public Location: are locations managed by VNG Cloud, used for testing endpoints that can be accessed via the internet
* Private location: are locations that you install and manage yourself, used for testing endpoints located on the internal network, not accessible from the internet.
