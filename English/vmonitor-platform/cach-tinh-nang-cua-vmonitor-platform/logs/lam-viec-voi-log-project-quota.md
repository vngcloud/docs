## Overview <a href="#tong-quan" id="tong-quan"></a>

A Log project is a term on vMonitor Platform that represents a Logs monitoring package with a specific capacity and time that you purchase on VNG Cloud. At a time you can own one or more Log projects in parallel and use them as a way to organize resources for groups or departments to use for different purposes.
