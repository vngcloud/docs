# Dashboard

### Overview <a href="#dashboard-tongquan" id="dashboard-tongquan"></a>

A Dashboard is a data visualization tool that helps users quickly find important information and better understand the data. A Dashboard in the vMonitor Platform is a group of charts used to monitor your resources from certain services, applications, or servers. The group of charts will clearly show you the health of the system.

On the vMonitor Platform, we define 2 types of Dashboards including:

* **Default Dashboard**: This type of Dashboard is automatically created by our system as soon as you enable monitoring for the services you're using or when you successfully set up monitoring for your hosts. The main characteristic of this Dashboard is that you can view, create copies, but cannot modify any parameters or Widgets within the Dashboard.
* **Custom Dashboard**: This type of Dashboard is created by you. The characteristics of this Dashboard are that you have full control to view, create new ones, duplicate, edit parameters, as well as add, remove, or arrange the Widgets within the Dashboard as you wish.

### Dashboard Rule <a href="#dashboard-phamvigioihandashboard" id="dashboard-phamvigioihandashboard"></a>

**Dashboard naming rules**

The following rules apply to naming Dashboards in the vMonitor Platform:

* The Dashboard name must be between 1 (minimum) and 50 (maximum) characters in length.
* The Dashboard name can only include uppercase letters, lowercase letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), dots (.), underscores (\_), hyphens (-), slashes (/) and the @ character.&#x20;
* The Dashboard name should not contain sensitive information (e.g., IP addresses, account names, login passwords,...).&#x20;
* The Dashboard name must be unique within a VNG Cloud account until it is deleted.&#x20;

Examples:

* Here are examples of valid and compliant Dashboard names following the proposed naming conventions:
  * monitor\_host@1

  * ...
* The following Dashboard names are valid but we do not recommend using them:
  * [docexamplewebsite.com](http://docexamplewebsite.com/)
