### Overview

A Metric quota is a term on the vMonitor Platform that represents a monitoring package of Metrics with a specific number of Resources and storage duration that you purchase on VNG Cloud. At any given time, you can own a Metric quota and use it to analyze data from your system.

### Deleting a Metric Quota

You have created an initial Metric quota that suits your needs. However, if your business requirements have changed and you no longer need the created Metric quota package, we encourage you to delete it to optimize costs.

To **delete** a **Metric quota**, you can:

1. Log in to [https://hcm-3.console.vngcloud.vn/vmonitor](https://hcm-3.console.vngcloud.vn/vmonitor). If you don't have an account, register for free [here](https://hcm-3.console.vngcloud.vn/vmonitor).
2. Select the **Quota & Usage** folder.
3. Choose the **Metric** section.
4. In the current Metric quota package, select **Delete**.
5. On the Metric quota deletion confirmation screen, select **Delete**.

After you delete the Metric quota package, it will disappear from your list of Metric quota packages. If your resources still have remaining usage time, we will refund the unused balance to your credit wallet. For detailed information on how vMonitor Platform calculates resource refund fees, please refer to [Pricing](../../../vserver/compute-hcm03-1a/pricing.md).

<mark style="color:red;">Since deleting a Metric quota carries risks (resources cannot be restored after deletion), we advise you to carefully consider before proceeding with the deletion.</mark>
