# Metrics

Metrics are measurement indicators used to evaluate the performance of a system, the effectiveness of a process, or any other activity. For the vMonitor Platform, metrics are used when you need to analyze detailed parameters of a system. You can determine the level of performance that the system can achieve. Consequently, the process of analyzing and evaluating the system will be faster and more accurate than ever before.
