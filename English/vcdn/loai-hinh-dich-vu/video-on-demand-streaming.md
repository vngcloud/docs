## **Data Distribution Mechanism** <a href="#videoondemandstreaming-cochephanphoidulieu-1" id="videoondemandstreaming-cochephanphoidulieu-1"></a>

### **Input data processing procedure** <a href="#quy-trinh-xu-ly-du-lieu-dau-vao" id="quy-trinh-xu-ly-du-lieu-dau-vao"></a>

The vCDN system connects to **the customer's Storage** to retrieve content, specifically:

* **Supported input formats** :
  * **MP4** (video), **MP3** (audio).
  * **HLS** and **MpegDash** (streaming standards).
* **Options for processing with original format** :
  * **MP4/MP3** : **Converted to HLS** , a popular format for playback on OTT (Over-the-Top) devices.
  * **HLS/MpegDash** : If the data is already in this format, the system keeps it as is (no conversion).
* **Media Segment** :
  * Optional length of each media segment when packaging into HLS.

### **Data processing on Media Preparation Server** <a href="#quy-trinh-xu-ly-du-lieu-tren-media-preparation-server" id="quy-trinh-xu-ly-du-lieu-tren-media-preparation-server"></a>

* **Format conversion** : The system reads the input file from origin and converts:
  * **MP4/MP3 → HLS** .
  * Read SMIL file (if any) to generate **Adaptive Bitrate (ABR)** standard .
* **SMIL support for Adaptive Bitrate** :
  * SMIL is a specification file containing bitrate information and corresponding video versions.
  * The system reads SMIL files from origin and converts them to HLS ABR, ensuring a smooth experience across multiple network speeds.
* **Data Distribution** : After conversion, files are pushed to **Edge Server** to serve viewers.

### **Output data** <a href="#du-lieu-dau-ra" id="du-lieu-dau-ra"></a>

The vCDN system provides popular delivery standards, supports HTTPS protocol and Adaptive Bitrate feature. Details are as follows:

* **Standard output paths**
  *   **MP4** : Stream files directly from origin (MP4 Progressive Streaming).

      ```
      https://<CDN Domain>/<đường dẫn file MP4 trên origin>
      ```
  *   **HLS** : Used for segmented content or has SMIL supporting ABR.

      ```
      https://<CDN Domain>/<đường dẫn file MP4/SMIL trên origin>/index.m3u8
      ```
  *   **MpegDash** :

      ```
      https://<CDN Domain>/<đường dẫn file manifest trên origin>
      ```
* **HTTPS Support**
  * **Default** : All CDNs support HTTPS via system SSL certificates.
  * **Custom** : Users can upload their own SSL certificates to use with custom domains.
* **Adaptive Bitrate Support (HLS SMIL ABR)**
  *   URLs supporting ABR via SMIL files:

      ```
      https://<CDN Domain>/<Đường dẫn tới file SMIL trên origin>/index.m3u8
      ```

## **Service Features** <a href="#videoondemandstreaming-tinhnangdichvu" id="videoondemandstreaming-tinhnangdichvu"></a>

* **Support for direct connection to Origin:** The vCDN system supports direct connection to Object Storage data sources using the S3-compatible protocol standard. This helps customers easily integrate data from popular cloud storage services or from vStorage.
* **Customize caching mechanism:** allows users to configure the level of data caching at Edge Servers, suitable for each type of content.
* **Origin Support when creating CDN:** The vCDN system allows defining data sources from Object Storage or Origin Server specified by the customer. This provides flexibility in integrating data from different sources.
* **HTTPS Support:** By default, all CDNs created support HTTPS to secure data. Users can also **upload their own SSL certificates** to use with their own domains.
* **Auto Redirect from HTTP to HTTPS** : Supports automatic redirection of all HTTP requests to HTTPS to enhance security and improve user experience.
* **Output link security:** Supports advanced security mechanisms to protect content, including: CORS, Whitelist/ Blacklist IP, Geo Block, HTTP Referer Block,...
* **Development Mode Support:** This feature allows you to temporarily disable caching on the Edge Server to support testing or testing content during development. All requests will be returned directly from Origin, allowing content to be updated immediately without clearing the cache.
* **Multi Audio Selection:**
  * **Audio separation function** :
    * Supports splitting and selecting different audio tracks in one MP4 file if the file contains multiple audio formats (e.g. multiple languages ​​or versions).
    * This feature is compatible with **Adaptive Bitrate (ABR)** and uses SMIL files for definition.
  *   **Multi Audio Selection URL Syntax (with ABR)** :

      ```
      https://<CDN Domain>/<Đường dẫn tới file SMIL trên VNGCloud Storage/Origin>/index.m3u8
      ```
