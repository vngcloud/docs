# Monitoring

vCDN provides a mechanism to monitor and track the performance of the entire customer's CDN service through the Portal interface or API&#x20;

Indicators will be provided visually with quick updates every minute and with a maximum delay of 5 minutes (near realtime).&#x20;

From there, customers can monitor the performance of the entire service or any service in real time or past data. Customers can easily access the Dashboard feature available on the Portal interface.
