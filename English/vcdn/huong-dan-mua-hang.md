# Pricing

Currently vCDN supports prepaid and postpaid packages when using the system. With prepaid packages, users recharge and make purchases in the system. For postpaid packages, the system will calculate user expenses incurred during the month and statistically calculate money for customers monthly. To go to the purchase page, users just need to click on the Buy More Traffic menu on the screen.

With the basic package, users who register to the system will apply this package by default.&#x20;

Standard package users will have to pay for 200,000 VND/month. For the pro package the price will be 500,000 VND/month and for Enterprise it will be 1,000,000 VND/month.&#x20;

With the user's monthly traffic consumption, the system will make statistics and calculate money for the user at the end of the month.&#x20;

## **Prepaid package** <a href="#huongdanmuahang-goitratruoc" id="huongdanmuahang-goitratruoc"></a>

Users can recharge and purchase packages and prices such as postpaid packages, and buy traffic to maintain and consume traffic for CDN. There are 2 types of traffic: Domestic (applied to domestic CDNs) and International (applied to international CDNs).&#x20;

Each type of traffic will have different costs. For domestic and standard traffic types, the retail price is 880 VND/ 1GB of traffic. And vCDN has additional tiered prices for users. The more they buy, the lower the price for users.
