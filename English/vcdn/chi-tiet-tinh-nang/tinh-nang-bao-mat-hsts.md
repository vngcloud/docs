# Security Feature HSTS

### Security Feature HSTS

HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security) is a web security policy mechanism that helps protect websites against man-in-the-middle attacks, such as protocol downgrade attacks and cookie hijacking. Enabling HSTS ensures that browsers interact with the server using only HTTPS connections, preventing certain types of network attacks from succeeding.
