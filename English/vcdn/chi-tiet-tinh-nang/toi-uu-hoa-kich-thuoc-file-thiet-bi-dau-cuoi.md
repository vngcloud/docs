# Optimizing End-Device File Size

Optimize images: The system will automatically compress images, and convert the format appropriate to the end user device in real time. If the device is mobile, the image size will be resized to fit the frame of the mobile device's screen. Customers can choose this mode when creating a CDN or editing an already created CDN. Besides, vCDN also supports Brotli compression standard\*\*:\*\* allowing customers to choose Brotli compression mode when creating a CDN or editing an already created CDN. The system will automatically switch back to GZIP if the terminal does not support the Brotli compression standard.
