# Server Cache Expiration

**Server Cache Expiration (TTL)** is an important mechanism used to determine how long vCDN will cache your resources. During this time, vCDN will not access your origin server and respond with results from the vCDN cache. The benefits of using Server Cache Expiration include:&#x20;

* Improve the performance&#x20;
* Reduce bandwidth usage&#x20;
* Enhance user experience.&#x20;

On vCDN, you can set Server Cache Expiration (TTL) from the minimum value of 30 minutes to the maximum value of 1 day that we support.

On vCDN, you can set Browser Cache Expiration from a minimum value of 30 minutes to a maximum value of 1 day that we support.
