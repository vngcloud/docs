# Security (Bảo mật)

VNG Cloud is committed to ensuring the security of both the physical and virtualized infrastructure that supports our services. We also provide services that allow customers to implement their own security measures for their systems hosted on VNG Cloud.

Database Service (DBaaS) security is crucial for protecting sensitive information and ensuring the integrity of your data. Therefore, VNG Cloud guarantees a secure environment through the following measures:

1. **Access Control:** We implement robust access control and authentication mechanisms to restrict unauthorized access to databases. We utilize role-based access control (RBAC) and strong authentication methods to effectively manage user permissions.
2. **Encryption:** We employ encryption techniques, such as SSL/TLS protocols, to encrypt data both in transit and at rest. Sensitive information is encrypted to prevent unauthorized access even in the event of data leakage.
3. **Regular Backups:** We perform regular backups of databases to minimize the risk of data loss due to potential security incidents. We maintain backups to ensure data recoverability in case of emergencies.
4. **Version Updates:** We always update to the latest releases provided by the DBaaS provider. New releases offer enhanced features and security, with better capabilities to address security vulnerabilities.
5. **Monitoring and Auditing:** We deploy comprehensive monitoring and auditing tools to track database activities, detect anomalies, and identify potential security breaches early on.
6. **Compliance and Regulations:** We ensure compliance with industry regulations and standards for data protection and privacy. We adhere to best practices and industry standards to maintain data security and confidentiality.

By prioritizing these security measures, our customers can significantly enhance the protection of their Database Services and ensure the safety of their valuable data. VNG Cloud also encourages customers to be proactive and timely in checking the security and safety of the services/resources they are using on VNG Cloud.
