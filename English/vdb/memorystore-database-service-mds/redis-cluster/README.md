# Redis Cluster

**Redis Cluster** on vDB is a Redis deployment with a **Non-sharding** architecture consisting of 1 Master node and up to 9 Replica nodes (2–10 nodes total), with automatic failover and vBackup integration for comprehensive data protection.

---

## Architecture

Redis Cluster on vDB follows a **1 Master – N Replicas** model:

- **Master node:** Handles all read and write operations.
- **Replica nodes (1–9):** Asynchronously replicate data from the Master, serve read operations, and are ready for failover.
- **Automatic Failover:** When the Master fails, a Replica is automatically promoted to become the new Master. The cluster continues to operate after failover completes.

```
┌─────────────┐
│   Master    │  ← Read / Write
└──────┬──────┘
       │ Async Replication
  ┌────┴────┐
  ▼         ▼
Replica 1  Replica 2 ...  ← Read / Failover
```

**Scope:** Redis Cluster on vDB currently supports **Non-sharding** mode (single shard only). Multi-shard sharding will be developed in a future release.

## Single-node vs Cluster Comparison

| Feature               | Single-node                          | Cluster (Non-sharding)               |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| Masters               | 1                                    | 1                                    |
| Max Replicas          | 5                                    | 9                                    |
| Automatic Failover    | No                                   | Yes                                  |
| Read Scaling          | Yes (via replicas)                   | Yes (via replicas)                   |
| Write Scaling         | No (single writer)                   | No (single writer)                   |
| Backup Integration    | No                                   | Yes (vBackup — Policy + Location)    |
| Best for              | Dev, staging, small workloads        | Production, High Availability        |

## Scaling Replicas

You can change the number of Replicas in a Cluster after creation with **no downtime**. The system performs scaling step by step:

- **Scale up:** Adds one replica at a time, waiting for each replica to complete its initial sync before adding the next.
- **Scale down:** Removes replicas in descending index order, waiting for each step to complete before proceeding.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Each change can only increase or decrease by **1 node** at a time. The UI shows only two options (current−1 or current+1) — jumping multiple steps in a single action is not allowed. This ensures each sync completes before the next step, preventing replication errors during abrupt scaling.

## Backup Integration (vBackup)

Redis Cluster has built-in integration with **vBackup** to protect your data:

- **Auto Backup:** Runs on the schedule defined by the Backup Policy selected during cluster creation.
- **Manual Backup:** Create a Full Snapshot on demand at any time from the cluster detail page.
- **Restore:** Create a new cluster from an existing restore point in Backup Center.

| Detail                | Value                                           |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Backup type           | Full Snapshot (Incremental not supported)       |
| Storage               | vStorage (S3-compatible) with Object Lock       |
| Concurrency limit     | 1 backup job at a time                          |
| When quota exceeded   | Returns `QuotaExceeded` error, no auto-retry   |
