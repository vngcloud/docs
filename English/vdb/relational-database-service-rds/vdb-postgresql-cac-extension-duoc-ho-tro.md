# vDB PostgreSQL - Supported Extensions

**vDB PostgreSQL - Supported Extensions**

PostgreSQL is renowned for its flexibility, allowing you to extend its core functionalities with various extensions.

By default, when you create a PostgreSQL database with vDB, several extensions are already enabled (listed below). Additionally, you can manually enable other extensions as needed.

#### 1. Extensions Already Enabled by Default:

For PostgreSQL, newly created databases will have extensions enabled from the `template1` database.

Once the database is created, you can check the enabled extensions by running the following commands:

```sql
\dx
```

or

```sql
select * from pg_extension;
```

Here is a list of the extensions that are enabled by default:

| No | Name          | Description                                                         | Version Supported by PostgreSQL |

You can check the list of supported extensions on your vDB by running the following command:

```sql
SELECT * FROM pg_available_extensions;
```

If an extension you need is not supported, please contact VNG Cloud Support for assistance.

#### 3. Notes:

* The **vector** extension is only available for vDB instances created after **01/08/2024**.
* To use it on pre-existing vDB instances, please contact VNG Cloud Support to enable it.
