# Create and Manage PostgreSQL Cluster

PostgreSQL Cluster enables deploying a database with a **1 Writer + N Readers** architecture, ensuring **High Availability** and the ability to **scale read** operations for your application. When the Writer encounters an issue, the system automatically fails over to a Reader without manual intervention.

For more information about concepts, architecture, and the comparison between Single Node and Cluster, please refer to [PostgreSQL Cluster](postgresql-cluster.md).

***

## Create a PostgreSQL Cluster

### Access the vDB Portal

You can access the vDB service interface in 2 ways:

* **Option 1**: Go to the GreenNode homepage at [https://dashboard.console.vngcloud.vn/](https://dashboard.console.vngcloud.vn/). On the main interface, navigate to **vServer** and select **vDB Relational** from the list of vServer products/services.
* **Option 2**: Go directly to the vDB Relational homepage at [https://vdb.console.vngcloud.vn/relational/database](https://vdb.console.vngcloud.vn/relational/database)

### Create a PostgreSQL Cluster

On the Database management interface, click **Create Database**. The creation process goes through the following steps:

#### Step 1: Basic Configuration

* **Cluster Name**: Enter a name for the cluster (6-20 characters, must start with a letter).
* **Database Engine**: Select **PostgreSQL**.
* **Deployment Type**: Select **Cluster** (this option only appears when the Engine is PostgreSQL).

{% hint style="info" %}
When selecting **Cluster** as the Deployment Type, the label changes from "Database Instance Name" to "Cluster Name".
{% endhint %}

**Restore from Backup (optional):**

When selecting **Cluster** as the Deployment Type, the system also displays a **Backup Image** section that allows you to restore the cluster from an existing backup:

* Expand a backup item to view **restore points**.
* Select a restore point if you want to create a cluster with data from that backup.
* If no restore point is selected, the cluster will be created with an empty database.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Note:** When restoring from a backup, the **Storage Size** of the new cluster must be greater than or equal to the **Backup Size** of the selected backup.
{% endhint %}

#### Step 2: Specifications

* **Engine Version**: Select the PostgreSQL version (e.g., 15, 14, 13...).
* **Flavor**: Select the instance configuration (vCPU, RAM). This configuration applies to **all nodes** in the cluster.
* **Storage Type**: Select the storage disk type.
* **Storage Size**: Select the storage capacity (includes data and logs).
* **Number of Nodes**: Select the number of nodes for the cluster (from 2 to 10). The system will display the corresponding **Role Distribution**:

| Number of Nodes | Role Distribution |
| --- | --- |
| 2 | 1 Writer + 1 Reader |
| 3 | 1 Writer + 2 Readers |
| 5 | 1 Writer + 4 Readers |
| 10 | 1 Writer + 9 Readers |

#### Step 3: DB Settings

* **Master Username**: Username for managing the database cluster.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Reserved Usernames:** You must not use the following usernames: `postgres`, `admin`, `cron_admin`, `robot_zmon`, `vngpooler`, `vngpam`, `vngrep`, `vngsuperrole`.
{% endhint %}

* **Master Password**: Password for the master user. The password must meet the following requirements:
  * Length of 8-32 characters.
  * Allowed characters: A-Z, a-z, 0-9, and special characters ($, ^, \_, <, >).
  * Must start with a letter (A-Z or a-z).
  * Must not start or end with a special character.

#### Step 4: Network & Security

* **Cloud Network (VPC & Subnet)**: Select the VPC and Subnet for the cluster. If you don't have one yet, you can create a new one following the guide [here](../../vserver/compute-hcm03-1a/network/virtual-private-cloud-vpc/).
* **Public Accessibility**: Enable if you want the cluster to have a Public IP and be accessible from the Internet; disable if you only want access via Private IP.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Note:** The Public Accessibility setting can only be selected **once** at the time of creation and cannot be changed afterwards.
{% endhint %}

#### Step 5: DB Options

* **Database Name**: Name of the database that will be automatically initialized.
* **DB Configuration Group** (optional): Select a Configuration Group to apply to the cluster.

#### Step 6: Backup Settings

{% hint style="info" %}
Backup Settings are **mandatory** when creating a PostgreSQL Cluster. You must select both a Backup Policy and a Backup Location.
{% endhint %}

* **Backup Policy**: Select the policy that defines the backup schedule and retention period from Backup Center.
* **Backup Location**: Select the backup storage location from Backup Center. The dropdown only shows locations with **status = Available** and **Product = vDB**, sorted in **newest first** order.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**If no Backup Location is available:**

If your account has no Backup Location in Available status, the Backup Location dropdown will appear with a red border and an error message. You need to click the link in the message to open Backup Center and create a new location before continuing to create the cluster.
{% endhint %}

If you don't have a Backup Policy yet, you can click the link to open Backup Center and create a new one.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** The Backup Location **cannot be changed** after the cluster has been created. Each cluster is permanently bound to a single Backup Location, so choose the appropriate location from the start.
{% endhint %}

#### Completion

In the **Summary** section on the right, review all configuration information. When everything is correct, click **Create Database** to complete. During initialization, the cluster will have **Building** status. When initialization is successful, the cluster will transition to **Active** status.
