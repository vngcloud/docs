# Pricing

Backup location is an extremely convenient backup data storage service, helping you protect important data from loss. To better understand the cost of using this service, we will learn about the two main factors that affect the price: **Usage (amount of data used)** and **Traffic (amount of data transmitted)** .

## Billing element <a href="#billing-element" id="billing-element"></a>

### Usage <a href="#usage-luong-du-lieu-su-dung" id="usage-luong-du-lieu-su-dung"></a>

* **Unit:** GB/hour
* **Billing principles:** You will only be charged for the actual amount of data you use per hour. For example:
  * If you use 100GB of data in 1 hour, you will be charged for 100GB.
  * If you only use 50GB in the next hour, you will only be charged for 50GB.
* **Advantage:**
  * Flexible: You only pay for what you use, not a fixed fee for a certain amount of capacity.
  * Save: If your usage needs change over time, you can adjust the amount of data you backup to suit and reduce costs.

### Traffic (Amount of data transmitted) <a href="#traffic-luong-du-lieu-truyen-tai" id="traffic-luong-du-lieu-truyen-tai"></a>

* **Unit:** GB
* **Charging principle:** Currently, VNG Cloud Backup is completely free of data transmission. This means you can upload and download backup data without paying any additional fees.

## Billing Method <a href="#billing-method" id="billing-method"></a>

Currently, VNG Cloud Backup supports both prepaid and postpaid forms:

## For postpaid <a href="#doi-voi-tra-sau" id="doi-voi-tra-sau"></a>

* Applicable subjects: Postpaid users at VNG Cloud
* Payment method: Pay later
* At the end of each month, VNG Cloud Backup will issue a service invoice, and users will proceed to pay the bill similar to other postpaid services. Note that one backup location will correspond to one invoice.

### For prepayment <a href="#doi-voi-tra-truoc" id="doi-voi-tra-truoc"></a>

* Applicable subjects: Prepaid users at VNG Cloud
* Payment method: [Hold credit](https://docs-vngcloud-vn.translate.goog/vng-cloud-document/vn/quan-ly-hoa-don-chi-phi-and-tai-nguyen-tren-vng-cloud/trai-nghiem-billing-and-kenh-thanh-toan/ve-billing-and-payment/thanh-toan/tam-giu-credit)
  * Accordingly, users need to prepare enough credits in their VNG Cloud account. Every day, the system will temporarily hold credits based on the actual usage of all backup locations.
  * In case the amount of credit in the account is not enough to hold, VNG Cloud will remind and take action if the user does not proactively top up more credit.
* At the end of each month, VNG Cloud will issue a service invoice, and users will proceed to pay the invoice similar to other postpaid services. Note that one backup location will correspond to one invoice.
  * The amount of credit temporarily held will be used to pay the service bill. If it is not enough, it will be deducted from the VNG Cloud account. If the amount temporarily held is more than the actual amount, we will refund it to the VNG Cloud account.
