{% tab title="New Product/Service" %}
### 1. VKS

VKS (VNGCloud Kubernetes Service) is a managed service on VNGCloud that helps you simplify the process of deploying and managing container-based applications. Kubernetes is an open source platform developed by Google, widely used to manage and deploy container applications on distributed environments.

This is a new product which replaced to vContainer with many improvements, you can learn more [here](../../vks/).

* _User guide_ [_here_](../../vks/)
* _Get started_ [_here_](https://vks.console.vngcloud.vn/overview)

For customers who using vContainer and then want to convert to VKS: see more guide[ here](../../vks/migration/)&#x20;

### 2. Service Endpoint&#x20;

This is a service that provides safe and secure private connections from VPCs to the vStorage service. This service acts as a connection bridge, helping to create a separate connection (internal connection, only in VNG Cloud) so that instances in VPC can communicate with vStorage.

* User guide [tại đây ](https://docs.vngcloud.vn/vng-cloud-document/v/vn/vnetwork)
* Getting start now by logging into [https://hcm-3.console.vngcloud.vn/vserver/](https://hcm-3.console.vngcloud.vn/vserver/) to create Service Endpoint

### 3. Public NAT instance

A NAT instance provides network address translation (NAT). You can use a NAT instance to allow resources in a private subnet to communicate with destinations outside the virtual private cloud (VPC), such as the internet or an on-premises network. The resources in the private subnet can initiate outbound traffic to the internet, but they can't receive inbound traffic initiated on the internet.

* Get started [here](https://hcm-3.console.vngcloud.vn/vserver/)

{% tab title="New feature" %}
### 1. Auto scale (vStorage)

The Auto-scale Quota feature (support for vStorage) allows you to set up the system to automatically expand storage capacity based on your actual usage and needs. Thereby helping users simplify management and optimize usage costs.
