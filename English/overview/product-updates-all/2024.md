**VKS**

**Private Cluster:** Previously, public clusters on VKS were using Public IP addresses to communicate between nodes and the control plane. To improve the security of your cluster, we have launched the private cluster model. The Private Cluster feature helps your K8S cluster to be as secure as possible, all connections are completely private from the connection between nodes to the control plane, the connection from the client to the control plane, or the connection from nodes to other products and services in VNG Cloud such as: vStorage, vCR, vMonitor, VNG Cloud APIs,...&#x20;

Private Cluster is the ideal choice for services that require strict access control, ensuring compliance with regulations on security and data privacy.

&#x20;For details on the 2 operating models of Cluster [here](https://docs.vngcloud.vn/vng-cloud-document/v/vn/vks/mo-hinh-hoat-dong)

**vLB auto scale:**&#x20;

Key benefits:

* Optimize performance: Ensure that vLBs always have enough resources to handle traffic, avoiding overload.&#x20;
* Saving costs: Automatically reduce the number of LBs when traffic is low, or increase the number of LBs when traffic increases, helping you save and optimize costs in the best way.
* Simplify management: No need to manually scale vLBs.&#x20;

Release date: 08/14/2024&#x20;

**Service Endpoint:**

In addition to connecting to the vStorage service released in June 2024, from now on, users can create Service Endpoints connecting to other services on VNG Cloud, including vServer, IAM, vMonitor.

Released date: 01/08/2024

**Backup Center & Vault**&#x20;

This is the new storage location of the backup center. Vault will provide more conveniences including:&#x20;

\+ Users can choose the location for the vault, currently supporting 2 locations, HCM04 and HAN01.&#x20;

\+ Vault support lock: Customers can set the time limit to lock backup data, avoid accidental deletion, compromise and data loss.&#x20;

\+ Users can choose a vault at a different location from the vServer. For example, if the backup server is in HCM, they can choose HN.&#x20;

\+ Vault HCM04 supports encryption by default (AES-256) at the infrastructure for all data recorded.&#x20;

Usecases suitable for customers are as follows:

\+ Backup cross zone: Backup data will be located at a DC independent of the compute infrastructure.&#x20;

\+ Backup cross site: Customers can use the server in HCM and save backup data to Hanoi and vice versa. References here DR Center Customers can set up DR for vServers with the HCM <-> HN option.&#x20;

\+ Customers can easily test / verify DR without impacting the running infrastructure.&#x20;

### 1. VKS

VKS (VNGCloud Kubernetes Service) is a managed service on VNGCloud that helps you simplify the process of deploying and managing container-based applications. Kubernetes is an open source platform developed by Google, widely used to manage and deploy container applications on distributed environments.

This is a new product which replaced to vContainer with many improvements, you can learn more [here](../../vks/).

* _User guide_ [_here_](../../vks/)
* _Get started_ [_here_](https://vks.console.vngcloud.vn/overview)

For customers who using vContainer and then want to convert to VKS: see more guide[ here](../../vks/migration/)&#x20;

### 2. Service Endpoint&#x20;

This is a service that provides safe and secure private connections from VPCs to the vStorage service. This service acts as a connection bridge, helping to create a separate connection (internal connection, only in VNG Cloud) so that instances in VPC can communicate with vStorage.

* User guide [tại đây ](https://docs.vngcloud.vn/vng-cloud-document/v/vn/vnetwork)
* Getting start now by logging into [https://hcm-3.console.vngcloud.vn/vserver/](https://hcm-3.console.vngcloud.vn/vserver/) to create Service Endpoint

### 3. Public NAT instance

A NAT instance provides network address translation (NAT). You can use a NAT instance to allow resources in a private subnet to communicate with destinations outside the virtual private cloud (VPC), such as the internet or an on-premises network. The resources in the private subnet can initiate outbound traffic to the internet, but they can't receive inbound traffic initiated on the internet.
