### 1. VKS

VKS (VNGCloud Kubernetes Service) is a managed service on VNGCloud that helps you simplify the process of deploying and managing container-based applications. Kubernetes is an open source platform developed by Google, widely used to manage and deploy container applications on distributed environments.

This is a new product which replaced to vContainer with many improvements, you can learn more [here](../../vks/).

* User guide [here](../../vks/)
* Get started [here](https://vks.console.vngcloud.vn/overview)

For customers who using vContainer and then want to convert to VKS: see more guide[ here](../../vks/migration/)&#x20;

### 2. Service Endpoint&#x20;

This is a service that provides safe and secure private connections from VPCs to the vStorage service. This service acts as a connection bridge, helping to create a separate connection (internal connection, only in VNG Cloud) so that instances in VPC can communicate with vStorage.

* User guide [tại đây ](https://docs.vngcloud.vn/vng-cloud-document/v/vn/vnetwork)
* Getting start now by logging into [https://hcm-3.console.vngcloud.vn/vserver/](https://hcm-3.console.vngcloud.vn/vserver/) to create Service Endpoint

### New Region in Hanoi – HAN-01

* Actice time: From June 5, 2024
* Services available on HAN-01:

_Compute:_ Initialize/resize VM

_BlockStore:_ Initialize Volume, Image, Backups, Snapshots

_Load Balancing:_ Load Balancers

_Virtual network_: Network ACL, Network Interfaces, Route tables, Security Groups, Floating IPs, VIP (virtual IP address), VPC Peering, Interconnects

_Other services including VKS, DB, BW,..._ will be integrated according to the roadmap soon in the near future.

* To enable Region HAN-01: Customers access Portal vServer and select Region on the top left. Initialization operations are similar to HCM03 User Manual
