**Nov, 2025**

#### **vDB – Redis version 7.2.11**

Updated Redis to version 7.2.11 to improve performance and compatibility.

#### **vLB – Access Log at AZ 1B, 1C HCM**

***

**Sep, 2025**

#### **VKS (GreenNode Kubernetes Service) – Automatically delete clusters with no active nodes after 30 days (System improvement)**

The system will automatically scan and remove clusters that have no active nodes for 30 consecutive days. Before deletion, warning emails will be sent to Customers to ensure they can proactively take action if they wish to retain the cluster — ensuring safety and transparency throughout the management process.\
This enhancement helps Customers save operational costs and avoid resource waste caused by inactive clusters.

**Jul, 2025**

#### **vStorage – FileStorage integrated with an additional HAN region**

The File Storage service is enhanced with two regions: HCM and HAN.\
Provides distributed file storage, effortless scalability, and the ability to access files from multiple instances simultaneously.

_Reference documentation available_ [here](../../vstorage/filestorage/bat-dau-voi-filestorage/)

**September, 2025**

#### **VKS – Multi-AZ Node Group Support**

Multi-AZ Node Group allows users to deploy worker nodes—where applications and workloads run—across multiple Availability Zones (AZs). This deployment model enhances Kubernetes system availability and fault tolerance, making it suitable for enterprise-grade, mission-critical applications.

#### **AI Gateway**

The latest update to AI Gateway introduces two key capabilities that help Customers operate more efficiently, reduce costs, and better manage AI model (LLM) usage:

* **Caching (Exact / Semantic Caching):**\
  The system automatically stores the results of repeated or semantically similar prompts. This helps significantly reduce the number of LLM model calls, optimize usage costs, and shorten response times for end users.
* **Rate Limit:**\
  Allows Customers to configure usage frequency limits for AI models, enabling effective control of traffic and costs while ensuring stable performance for applications using AI Gateway.

With these enhancements, AI Gateway now supports: Multi-LLM Support; comprehensive monitoring via metrics and logs; safety features for sensitive user information such as authentication tokens and API keys; and the newly added Caching and Rate Limit functionalities.

#### **vNetwork – vDNS Integration for Endpoint Services**

vDNS is a DNS (Domain Name System) service designed specifically for the Private Cloud environment on GreenNode, providing secure, flexible, and efficient domain name management and resolution within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).\
Previously, vDNS supported integration with services such as vLB (Load Balancing) and VKS.\
This update extends vDNS integration to Endpoint services, enabling connectivity between VPCs and GreenNode services including HCM-03 (vStorage, vMonitor, vServer, vCR, IAM) and HCM-04 (vStorage).

#### **vStorage – Lifecycle Feature**

Integrated Lifecycle transition for objects in regions HCM04/HAN02, enabling automated movement of objects between tiers within the same bucket to optimize storage costs.

_Reference documentation available_ [here](../../vstorage/object-storage/object-storage-han02/features-of-object-storage/working-with-bucket/working-with-buckets-via-vstorage-portal/bucket-lifecycle.md)

***

**August, 2025**

#### **VKS – Placement Group Support per Node Group**

This enhancement enables more effective control over node placement to optimize performance and improve availability. It is especially useful for workloads that require physical distribution (anti-affinity) or co-location (affinity) to reduce latency and improve system responsiveness.

#### **vNetwork – Multi-AZ Support for Endpoint, NAT, VPN**

Multi-AZ support empowers Customers to design HA architectures more proactively, ensuring system continuity even if one AZ experiences issues.

***

**July, 2025**

#### **vStorage – Object Storage (HCM04)**

* Integrated multiple storage tiers in region HCM04 to align with varying data storage needs and cost requirements.
* Publicly available tiers: **Instant Archive**, **Gold**.

_Reference documentation available_ [here](../../vstorage/object-storage/object-storage-han02/getting-started-with-object-storage/step-1-create-a-project.md)

#### **vLB – ALB Support for CORS Header, ALPN, SSL Policy**

* vLB/ALB – CORS Response Header, ALPN, SSL Policy (07/2025)
* Updated ALB to support CORS response headers and customizable ALPN and SSL Policies, enhancing security and improving compatibility.

***

**June, 2025**

#### **vDB-Kafka – Metric/Logs Support**

The new Metrics/Logs feature allows Customers to monitor the operational status of their Kafka clusters directly from the management interface. This integration simplifies system monitoring, enhances operational proactiveness, and reduces downtime risks for applications relying on Kafka.

***

**April, 2025**

#### **vStorage – Object Storage (HAN02)**

Integrated the new HAN02 region into the vStorage portal, providing more powerful and flexible storage capabilities compared to the existing HAN01 region.\
All customers on region HAN01 are migrated to HAN02, and region HAN01 is officially decommissioned.

_Reference documentation available_ [here](../../vstorage/object-storage/object-storage-han02/)

***

**March, 2025**

#### **vLB – Launch of vLB Autoscale in region HAN**

* vLB – Autoscale in Region HAN (03/2025)
* Activated Autoscale capabilities in the Hanoi region, enabling automatic scaling based on real-time workloads.
