# DDoS

Ensuring your services remain available and secure is our top priority. Our built-in DDoS protection system safeguards your infrastructure against common volumetric attacks, helping to maintain optimal performance and availability.

## Types of DDoS Attacks

To better understand our protection capabilities, here's a brief overview of different DDoS attack types:

* Volumetric Attacks: These attacks overwhelm network bandwidth by flooding target services with a high volume of traffic. Examples include UDP floods, DNS reflection, and NTP reflection attacks.
* Application-Layer Attacks: These attacks target specific web applications or services, aiming to exhaust server resources through legitimate-looking traffic. Examples include HTTP floods and Slowloris attacks.

## Protection Capabilities

Our DDoS protection automatically detects and mitigates various volumetric attack vectors, including but not limited to:

* DNS Reflection
* NTP Reflection
* UDP Floods
* SYN Floods

## Protected OSI Layers

Our protection system specifically targets network (Layer 3) and transport (Layer 4) layer attacks. It does not cover application layer (Layer 7) attacks. Customers requiring protection against Layer 7 threats should consider additional measures tailored specifically to their applications.

## Protected Services

The DDoS protection extends to all key services within our public cloud platform, including:

* vServer
* vLB
* vStorage
* vKS

## Always-On Protection

Our DDoS protection service is automatically active for every customer, providing constant and comprehensive defense without the need for configuration or additional fees. This ensures seamless and worry-free protection, enabling you to focus on your core business operations.
