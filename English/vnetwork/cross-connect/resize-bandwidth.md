# Resize Bandwidth

In case the current bandwidth does not meet the needs of the Cross Connect service, users can change the bandwidth by Rezing the Bandwidth Package.

**Changing the Bandwidth Package**

Bandwidth is a configuration parameter that defines the data transmission speed. When it is necessary to change the bandwidth for the connection, users will select a new package from the available list.

If there is a need to change the Bandwidth for Cross Connect while in use, it is entirely possible to make the change. The system will calculate the additional costs or refund the balance to the user.

The cost and calculation method for the new Bandwidth package will appear on the right side of the screen when the user performs the 'Resize Package' action.

**How to Perform the Resize**

Before changing the Bandwidth package of Cross Connect, you should determine the appropriate package and bandwidth that fits your needs. See more at Bandwidth Packages.

The detailed steps to make the change are as follows:

**Step 1:** Successfully log in to VNG Cloud, and from the Console screen, navigate to the vNetwork service;

**Step 2:** On the left menu bar of the vNetwork interface, select the Cross Connect section;

**Step 3:** The screen will be directed to the Cross Connect List screen;

**Step 4:** Find the Cross Connect that you want to change the Bandwidth for, select the 'Actions' button, then click '**Resize**';

**Note:**

* If switching to a package with **higher bandwidth than the current one**, the system will automatically calculate **the additional fees** that the user needs to pay for the bandwidth increase.
* If switching to a package with **lower bandwidth than the current one**, the system will automatically calculate **the refund amount** (if applicable) for the user when reducing the bandwidth.
{% endhint %}

**Step 6:** After selecting the appropriate package, users can view a summary of the additional costs or the refund amount in case of selecting a lower bandwidth package. Press the "<mark style="color:blue;">**Resize Package**</mark>" button to complete. When the status of CrossConnect changes from '<mark style="color:blue;">**Changing**</mark>' back to '<mark style="color:blue;">**Active**</mark>', the bandwidth resize process is completed.
