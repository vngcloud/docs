# Bandwidth Packages

With the Cross Connect service, VNG Cloud currently offers bandwidth packages for customers to easily choose from, including:



<table><thead><tr><th width="74">No.</th><th width="156">Cross Connect</th><th>Bandwidth Packages</th><th width="117">Bandwidth</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>HCM03-HAN01</td><td>519-C-Dedicated-10Mbps</td><td>10 Mbps</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>HCM03-HAN01</td><td>519-C-Dedicated-50Mbps</td><td>50 Mbps</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>HCM03-HAN01</td><td>519-C-Dedicated-100Mbps</td><td>100 Mbps</td></tr></tbody></table>

During usage, if users need to change the bandwidth, they can resize the bandwidth package to suit their needs.
