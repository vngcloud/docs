# Security

GreenNode is responsible for protecting the underlying infrastructure of GreenNode services, such as data centers and virtualization platforms. GreenNode also provides you with services that you can use securely.

Cloud security at GreenNode is the highest priority. As an GreenNode customer, you benefit from a data center and network architecture that are built to meet the requirements of the most security-sensitive organizations. Security is a shared responsibility between GreenNode and you. When you use GreenNode services, your responsibility includes the following areas:

* Controlling network access to your instances, for example, through configuring your VPC and security groups.
* Managing the credentials used to connect to your instances.
* Managing the guest operating system and software deployed to the guest operating system, including updates and security patches.
* Controlling permissions by configuring the IAM roles and the permissions associated with those roles.
