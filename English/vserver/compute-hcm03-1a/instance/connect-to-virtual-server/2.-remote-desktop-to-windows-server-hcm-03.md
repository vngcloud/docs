# Connecting a Windows Server by Remote Desktop (RDP)

You can easily connect to Windows servers created from the GreenNode dashboard using Remote Desktop. To do this, you need to download RDP and follow our instructions below. RDP is available on most versions of Windows and is also available for Mac OS.

To learn how to connect to a Linux instance, please refer to the guide "[Connecting to a Linux server by SSH clien](1.-ssh-login-to-server-linux-hcm-03.md)t" for instructions on connecting to your server.

**To connect to a Windows server:**

* **Install RDP**:
  * \[Windows] By default, Windows will include the RDP Client. To verify, type mstsc at the Command Prompt window. If your computer doesn't recognize this command, visit the Windows homepage and search for the download link for the [Microsoft Remote Desktop ](https://www.microsoft.com/vi-vn/windows)application.
  * \[Mac OS X] Download the [Microsoft Remote Desktop](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-remote-desktop/id1295203466?mt=12) app from the Mac App Store.
  * \[Linux] Use [Remmina](https://remmina.org/)
* **The server must be running:**
  * After the server is successfully initialized, its information will appear on the server list page of the dashboard, and the server status will be Active.
* I**nbound rule of the security group created:**
  * Ensure that the security group associated with your instance allows RDP traffic (port 3389) from your IP address. The default security group does not allow RDP traffic by default. For more information, see Allow inbound traffic for your Windows instances.
* The server's **network interface** needs to have a public IP address.
*   **Connection information to the server**: To find the connection information for the server, please check the registered email.<br>

    **Note:** This information is secure and only sent to the registered email. GreenNode cannot intervene to recover server login information (username/password/key) in any situation.

* **Q. Can I connect multiple computers to the same Windows server at the same time?**\
  Yes, you can use Remote Desktop to connect multiple computers to the same Windows server, creating a multi-user environment. This is often referred to as Remote Desktop Services (RDS) or Terminal Services. However, the number of users may be limited by the number of Remote Desktop Services (RDS) sessions allocated to the server.
