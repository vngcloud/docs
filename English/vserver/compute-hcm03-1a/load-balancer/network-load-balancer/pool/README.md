# Pool

A Pool (also known as a Server Group) is a critical component in a Load Balancing system. It is responsible for distributing traffic to backend servers, improving the performance, availability, and reliability of your services.

#### The Main Purpose of a Pool

The primary goal of a Pool is load balancing. It ensures that incoming traffic is evenly and efficiently distributed across backend servers. This prevents any single server from becoming overloaded while others remain idle.

#### Pool Components

A Pool consists of backend servers, referred to as "Pool Members." These Pool Members serve requests and respond to users or devices through the Load Balancer.
