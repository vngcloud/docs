**Data Recovery After an Incident**

One day, in a large enterprise operating in the financial services sector, they deployed a critical virtual server to run a database containing valuable information of thousands of customers and millions of transactions. This server was a vital backbone system, and its stability was crucial to maintaining the company's business operations.

One morning, the system administrator received a concerning alert about this server. Upon investigation, they realized that the server was experiencing a serious hardware malfunction. The data on the server had been corrupted and was inaccessible. Even a backup system could take several hours to become operational again, and the company couldn't afford to wait that long.

In this urgent situation, the system administrator quickly decided to utilize the Snapshot feature of the server. They immediately created a Snapshot to initiate the data recovery process. With the support of the technical team, they restored the server's state from the Snapshot.

The recovery process was successful, and the server was back up and running in a short period of time. The company managed to avoid a crisis situation and prevent the loss of important data. They learned a valuable lesson about the importance of using Snapshots to ensure consistency and readiness in case of unexpected incidents.
