# Resist attacks from Hackers or malware infections

The Dreaded Hacker Attack and the Breakthrough in Super Protection Courtesy of Snapshots

In a large financial organization, security and data protection are top priorities. Their server systems and crucial databases contain sensitive information about customers, financial transactions, and high-level management data. However, one day, this organization faced a powerful malware attack from a cunning hacker.

The hacker infiltrated the organization's system through an unpatched security vulnerability and infected malware into some critical servers. When the malware activated, it encrypted the data on those servers and demanded ransom for decryption. The organization wasn't willing to easily comply and pay the ransom, so they had to find a way to swiftly and securely restore the data.

Before the attack occurred, the organization routinely created Snapshots for all their servers and important volumes. This created a safe escape route. They used the Snapshot feature to restore the data to its pre-attack and pre-malware-infected state.

After applying the Snapshot, they restored the servers and data to their state before the incident. This eradicated the effects of the malware, and the crucial data returned to its original state.

Following the data restoration, the organization bolstered system security and ensured that security vulnerabilities were patched. They also implemented measures to prevent future attacks and enhance the protection of their important data.

Thanks to the use of the Snapshot feature, the organization was able to restore crucial data after a powerful malware attack. This helped them avoid data loss and prolonged system downtime. This is particularly crucial in the financial industry, where data security and consistency are paramount.
