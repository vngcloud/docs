# Activate Snapshot

### &#x20;**Overview**

Activating the Snapshot service is free. However, after you create a Snapshot, by default, fees will be incurred based on the size and storage duration of the Snapshots. It is important to monitor your Snapshot size and the associated costs. We recommend that you regularly delete unnecessary Snapshots. For detailed information on Snapshot billing, please refer to the[ How to calculate Snapshot Service Charges](how-to-calculate-a-snapshot-service-charges.md) document.

**To activate the Snapshot service for GreenNode's cloud computing service, please follow these steps:**

2\. On the Snapshot page, locate and click on "**Activate Snapshot service**".
