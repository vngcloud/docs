# What is vServer?

vServer - VNG Cloud Service is a virtual server service provided by VNG that allows you to easily deploy all types of servers with high performance including applications, services and data stored remotely to your computer quickly in the cloud computing environment, Help meet all customer needs without having to invest upfront in hardware. Cloud servers are also very flexible in that they are scalable and easily set up in minutes, in addition to providing other advanced services and tools such as VPC (Virtual Private Cloud), vLB (LoadBalancing as a service), Cloud Firewall (using Juniper's vSRX), vContainer, vBackup... to support users in the most optimal way.

vServer service provides you with leading solutions including:

* Set up a virtual server environment quickly, simply and automatically on VNG Cloud's leading advanced cloud computing technology.
* Diverse and flexible directory of server configurations according to hardware information of CPU, Memory, Disk, GPU ... is optimized by the VNG Cloud team for each type of work need as well as appropriate cost.
* The rich and varied Linux/Windows operating systems are prepared for server initialization processes called System Image. Besides, it is impossible to ignore the images with specialized software that are packaged and tested by the VNGCloud engineer team.
* Provide block storage with VNG Cloud Block Storage (Volume) service for virtual servers with high availability and performance with flexible scalability.
* The secure server access process eliminates the traditional password element of public key pairs, automatically completely automating the initialization of a new server.
* Fully automate the creation of scheduled backups as well as longer-term storage on Backup Vault.
* The leading solution in providing Cloud Firewall security with advanced technologies such as virtual firewalls, role-based permissions control, intranet isolation, anti-virus suite, and traffic throttling to protect Protect your data and resources, and improve your security
* Efficiently distribute your network usage traffic to a group of servers via vLB (LoadBalancing as a service)
* Your virtual networks are isolated from the rest of the VNG Cloud and can optionally connect to your own network, called a virtual private network (VPC).
* Connecting to many other services of VNG Cloud, allowing you to build diverse solutions for many scenarios to optimize workloads while saving output bandwidth.
