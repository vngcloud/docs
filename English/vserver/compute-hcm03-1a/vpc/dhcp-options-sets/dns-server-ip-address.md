# DNS Server IP Address

The default IP addresses of VNG Cloud for use in DHCP options sets are:

* <mark style="color:blue;">**10.166.12.196**</mark>&#x20;
* <mark style="color:blue;">**10.166.12.197**</mark>&#x20;

This ensures that you can access the basic services of VNG Cloud. You can click "**Set to optimize**" to specify DNS server IP addresses to meet your needs.

**Important**

Before customizing the DNS server IP addresses, note the following:

* The system is automatically assigning the VNG Cloud IPs 10.166.12.196 and 10.166.12.197. If you remove these addresses, you may not be able to use the basic services of VNG Cloud.
* VNG allows you to set up to a maximum of 4 DNS server IP addresses in one DHCP options set.
