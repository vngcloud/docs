# Package Bandwidth Share

The Share bandwidth package offers high-speed bandwidth shared among multiple customers. The speed of this package may vary at different times of the day. **This package is suitable for small businesses or projects that do not require large and consistently stable bandwidth.** If you only need bandwidth to maintain basic activities without high network performance requirements, this is the most reasonable choice for you.

**Note:**

* IP addresses with the ATTACHED status mean that they have already been assigned to a bandwidth package. When you add these ATTACHED IP addresses to your bandwidth package, they will be removed from the old package and reassigned to the new one. This ensures that an IP address can only be assigned to one bandwidth package at a time.
