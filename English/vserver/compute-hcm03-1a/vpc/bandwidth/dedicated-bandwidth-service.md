# Package Bandwidth Pay As You Go

The Pay As You Go bandwidth package requires you to pay for the amount of bandwidth used beyond the free bandwidth package (VNG Dedicated). This Pay As You Go package includes three specific packages:

* **PAYG-ALL**: This package allows you to use unlimited bandwidth for both domestic and international traffic. You will pay for the total bandwidth used beyond the free limit, regardless of whether the traffic is domestic or international.
* **PAYG-DOMESTIC**: This package applies to domestic bandwidth usage. You will pay for the amount of bandwidth used beyond the free limit dedicated to **domestic** traffic. In this package, international traffic will follow the default package configuration.
* **PAYG-INTERNATIONAL**: This package applies to international bandwidth usage. You will pay for the amount of bandwidth used beyond the free limit dedicated to **international** traffic. In this package, domestic traffic will follow the default package configuration.

**Note:**

* IP addresses with the ATTACHED status mean that they have already been assigned to a bandwidth package. When you add these ATTACHED IP addresses to your bandwidth package, they will be removed from the old package and reassigned to the new one. **This ensures that an IP address can only be assigned to one bandwidth package at a time.**
