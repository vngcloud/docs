### **Add IP Addresses to the Package** **Note**

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:**

* You can only add IPs to this bandwidth package, but you cannot remove IPs with default bandwidth.
* IP addresses with the ATTACHED status mean that they have already been assigned to a bandwidth package. When you add these ATTACHED IP addresses to your bandwidth package, they will be removed from the old package and reassigned to the new one. **This ensures that an IP address can only be assigned to one bandwidth package at a time.**
