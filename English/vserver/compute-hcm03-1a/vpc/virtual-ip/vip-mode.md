# VIP mode

In high availability (HA) systems, a **Virtual IP (VIP)** is an abstract IP. It can move between nodes/servers to keep services reachable.

When you design a VIP-based HA setup, you typically choose one mode: **Active/Active** or **Active/Passive**.

Choosing the right mode affects architecture, performance, and cost.

## 1. Active/Active Mode

#### Definition

In **Active/Active**, **all nodes** are active at the same time. They all receive and process traffic. Nodes coordinate to keep data consistent and performance stable.

#### Key characteristics

* **Load distribution**: A load balancer spreads traffic across nodes.
* **Higher throughput and easier scale-out**: Add nodes with minimal disruption.
* **High availability**: If one node fails, others keep serving traffic.
* **More complexity**: Requires solid data sync and load-balancing design.

#### Real-world examples

* **Web server clusters**: Run multiple web nodes behind NGINX or AWS ELB.
* **Distributed databases**: Systems like **Cassandra** or **CockroachDB**.
* **CDNs**: **Cloudflare** or **Akamai** run many edge nodes in parallel.

## 2. Active/Passive Mode

#### Definition

In **Active/Passive**, only one node is **Active** at any time. The other node is **Passive** and stays on standby.

If the active node fails, the VIP moves to the passive node. Service resumes after a short failover window.

#### Key characteristics

* **Simpler operations**: One active node is easier to observe and debug.
* **Safe redundancy**: The standby node is ready to take over.
* **Lower cost**: One node serves traffic, one waits.
* **Brief downtime on failover**: Seconds to minutes, depending on setup.

#### Real-world examples

* **Database failover**: SQL Server clusters, or MySQL primary/replica.
* **HA firewalls**: One active firewall, one standby firewall.
* **Internal enterprise apps**: ERP/CRM/accounting systems with steady traffic.

## 4. Recommended model

* **Active/Active** fits **mission-critical** systems and high traffic workloads. It also fits multi-zone or multi-region designs.
* **Active/Passive** fits **internal** apps and cost-focused setups. It also fits workloads that can tolerate brief failover.
