# Kubernetes Cluster

### **Overview** <a href="#kubernetescluster-overview" id="kubernetescluster-overview"></a>

Kubernetes Cluster is a distributed system consisting of multiple nodes working together to manage and deploy container applications using Kubernetes. Kubernetes is an open source platform developed by Google, widely used to manage and deploy container applications on a distributed environment.

A Kubernetes Cluster consists of the following main components:

* **Master Node**: Is the control center of the Kubernetes cluster, where the entire system is managed and controlled. The Master Node contains components such as the Kubernetes API Server, Scheduler, and LoadBalancer Controller.
* **Minion Node**: The servers that do the actual work of the container application. Each Worker Node runs one or more pods to contain containers. The main components on the Worker Node include Kubernetes Kubelet (communicating with Master Node), Container Runtime (like Docker) and kube-proxy (managing proxy network).
* **Pod**: The smallest unit in Kubernetes, containing one or more containers that share network and storage resources. Each Pod has a unique IP address and is scheduled to be deployed on Worker Nodes.
* **Service**: Represents a collection of Pods, providing a unique IP address and domain name for external access to the Pods. Services help ensure scalability and manageability of applications in the Kubernetes Cluster.
* **Volume**: Stores data for containers in Kubernetes. Provides Pod-independent data volume feature, ensuring no data is lost when the Pod fails or regenerates.

When deploying applications in the Kubernetes Cluster, users simply create objects such as Pods, Services, and Volumes through the console or Terraform. The Kubernetes system automatically identifies and distributes Pods to available Minion Nodes, ensuring application availability and scalability.

### **How to use Kubernetes Cluster** <a href="#kubernetescluster-howtousekubernetescluster" id="kubernetescluster-howtousekubernetescluster"></a>

To use a Kubernetes cluster, you can do the following:

1. **Application Deployment:** Kubernetes cluster allows you to deploy applications and services in containers. Using configuration and resource files, you can define and deploy your applications on the cluster.
2. **Resource management:** Kubernetes cluster helps manage and distribute resources between containers on Worker Nodes. You can define resource requirements for each application, and Kubernetes will ensure that resources are delivered and used efficiently.
3. **Auto Scaling**: With a Kubernetes cluster, you can dynamically scale applications based on workloads. As the load increases, Kubernetes can automatically deploy more copies of the application on the Worker Nodes to meet the load demand.
4. **Version management**: Kubernetes cluster allows easy version management of applications. You can update, deploy, and manage new versions of your apps dynamically and without interruption to your running apps.
5. **Monitoring and Troubleshooting**: Kubernetes provides built-in monitoring tools to monitor the health and performance of applications in the cluster. It also supports automated troubleshooting by automatically restarting the container or redeploying the application as needed.

Using a Kubernetes cluster simplifies the deployment and management of container applications, increases system availability and scalability, and reduces time and effort in managing related tasks application deployment. In addition, users can take advantage of flexible scalability, performance management, and automation in distributed container application deployment and management.
