### Overview <a href="#ketnoinhieudammay-multicloud-connection-tongquan" id="ketnoinhieudammay-multicloud-connection-tongquan"></a>

The cloud computing service in Vietnam and worldwide has been developing positively and robustly for several years. Therefore, in addition to using cloud services in Vietnam, enterprises also utilize cloud computing services such as Amazon Web Services (AWS). In some cases, this requires them to synchronize, access, and transfer large amounts of data between the domestic cloud environment and AWS.

The multi-cloud connection feature provided by GreenNode helps you establish a dedicated line between GreenNode and another cloud service provider. In this way, GreenNode can be connected to another cloud service provider, meeting the business access requirements across multiple cloud service providers and enhancing business connectivity while ensuring connectivity between clouds.

GreenNode provides an end-to-end process to configure resources. You simply need to place an order on the official website of GreenNode to activate the multi-cloud connection capability. This enables the deployment of access rights between multiple cloud service providers.

Using dedicated leased lines helps eliminate the need to use the Internet for transmission, ensuring transmission security for enterprise data.

AWS is used in the example connected to GreenNode using the multi-cloud connection feature. The architecture of the multi-cloud connection solution includes the following components:

* Multi-cloud connection instance: a logical entity used to connect GreenNode to AWS.
* Virtual Border Router (VBR): the virtual border router connects the Cloud Enterprise Network developed by GreenNode. VBR acts as a bridge to transmit data from the GreenNode data center to AWS.

Interconnect: allows you to establish a network connection to connect Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) to GreenNode. Interconnect acts as a bridge to transmit data from the AWS data center to GreenNode.
