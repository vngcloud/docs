# Using a combination of Interconnect connection methods

**"Maximized Integration: Combining Multicloud, Hybrid, and VPN Interconnect"**

The Multicloud Interconnect use case in this enterprise is confronted with increasing complexity in managing and integrating cloud resources from multiple providers. To address this challenge, they have decided to utilize Multicloud Interconnect, a multi-platform cloud connectivity solution. This allows them to leverage the unique advantages of both AWS and VNG Cloud by deploying applications and storing data across both platforms.

Using Multicloud Interconnect enables this enterprise to easily move data between two different clouds and flexibly navigate through cloud environments. This helps them maximize the flexibility and scalability of the cloud while maintaining diversity in application deployment and data management.

However, cloud connectivity is just part of this enterprise's overall mission. They also have to ensure that their information is securely and efficiently protected. To accomplish this, the enterprise has deployed VPN Interconnect to ensure information security and connectivity between their branch offices in Da Nang and Hanoi with the headquarters in Ho Chi Minh City.

VPN connectivity allows employees at branch offices to securely access internal resources and applications remotely, while ensuring that data is not leaked or accessed unlawfully. This is particularly important in today's business environment, where safeguarding critical information becomes increasingly crucial.

Furthermore, the enterprise has chosen to deploy Direct Interconnect to ensure direct and fast connectivity to their cloud provider. Instead of relying on the public Internet, they have leased a private line from the headquarters to the nearby cloud provider's data center.

This Direct Interconnect connection enhances performance for the enterprise's critical applications, reducing latency and ensuring they can access the cloud environment quickly and reliably. This is particularly important for critical applications and services that require high reliability and low latency.

In summary, this enterprise has employed a savvy combination of Multicloud Interconnect, VPN Interconnect, and Direct Interconnect to manage and optimize their cloud resources connectivity and security. This helps them maintain flexibility, security, and performance in today's multi-platform cloud environment.
