# Create a Transfer Job

If you have not used any VNG Cloud services (have not registered an account with VNG Cloud), you need to register an account with VNG Cloud Service here to access VNGCloud DataSync. To start using the service, you need to create a transfer job. In DataSync, a transfer job is a task configured to transfer data between a source and a destination. At a time you can own one or more Transfer jobs in parallel and use them for different purposes.

**Getting Started with DataSync, you can follow these steps below:**

   * To transfer all data in container01, leave this field blank.
5. Enter **Access Key/ Secret Key** : enter your access key and secret key. This S3 key pair is created and managed via IAM, please refer to [IAM for vStorage](../../identity-and-access-management-iam/cach-phan-quyen-iam-cho-dich-vu-vng-cloud/iam-cho-vstorage.md) .

**Step 5.2:** After entering all the required information in the fields above, you can choose to test the connection by clicking the **Test connection** button.
