The fact that at some times the total capacity (usage) displayed on the vStorage portal is different from the total size of the files displayed on the local computer may be due to a number of reasons related to information retrieval, information synchronization, caching, etc. of the vStorage system and other systems. Therefore, the client tool can be used to accurately check the actual storage capacity information on the vStorage service.</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>N/A</td><td>The bucket list on vStorage Portal is different from the bucket list displayed on the client tools</td><td><ul><li><p>The vStorage service supports multiple <strong>user interaction interfaces</strong> such as:</p><ol><li>UI: vStorage Portal, Cyberduck, S3 Browser</li><li>CLI: Aws CLI, mc, s3cmd, v.v.</li><li>API: vStorage APIs, vStorage Restful APIs, vStorage S3 APIs</li><li>SDK: MinIO SDK, AWS SDK cho các ngôn ngữ Java, Python, Golang, C#, NodeJS, v.v.</li></ol></li><li>Each of these <strong>user interfaces</strong> will choose to display vStorage resources (projects, buckets, objects, versions, metadata, etc.) for different purposes, so there may be differences in the list of vStorage resources listed and displayed.</li><li>Most <strong>user interfaces</strong> have differences in listing and displaying buckets. Some show bucket versions, etc. and some do not.

During the file upload process, some segments may be uploaded, some segments may not be uploaded due to errors such as network problems, uploading > 1000 segments, your client tools are stopped, hanged, etc. The file is then considered as an unsuccessful upload, the uploaded segments are considered as incomplete segments or garbage segments and are taking up your storage space.</li><li>You can choose some client tools that support cleaning these garbage segments to clean them up and free up storage space. For a list of user-side tools that support cleaning garbage segments and cleaning instructions, please refer to the user manual of each tool in this section.</li><li>At the moment, vStorage does not support the garbage segment cleaning feature. We are looking into solutions to support it in the future. For now, if you have problems with garbage segments, we recommend using the garbage cleaning solution provided by the client tools.</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table>
