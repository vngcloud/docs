## Auto-renew a project <a href="#gia-han-tu-dong-project" id="gia-han-tu-dong-project"></a>

In addition to manually renewing a project, we also support you to set up automatic renewal through the Auto-renew feature.

The automatic renewal feature is a system feature that supports automatic renewal of expired services more easily for prepaid customers. Customers do not need to worry about when the service expires to access the vStorage Portal to renew, pay,...

7 days before the service expires, the system will send an email notification about the automatic service renewal. During these 7 days, you will receive 1 notification email each day.

The system will automatically renew 3 days before the service expires:

* If you have enough credits, all services will be renewed. When the renewal is successful or failed, we will send you an email containing information about the successful/failed renewal. The service renewal payment history will also be stored on the vConsole system. For more information, visit [the vConsole Dashboard](https://dashboard.console.vngcloud.vn/payment-history) .
* If there are not enough credits, the system will try to renew the services until there are no more credits. When the renewal is successful or failed, we will send you an email containing the successful/failed renewal information. The service renewal payment history will also be stored on the vConsole system. For more information, visit the vConsole [Dashboard](https://dashboard.console.vngcloud.vn/payment-history) .

<details>

<summary>Set up auto-renewal when creating a project</summary>

3. Select **the automatic renewal cycle** . We offer renewal cycles including: 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, 24 months, 36 months. When you select the renewal cycle, the system will automatically calculate the validity period of the new storage cycle and the total amount you need to pay for the **project** renewal .

For a list of vStorage payment types and how project renewals are charged, see [How Charges Are Charged](https://docs-vngcloud-vn.translate.goog/vng-cloud-document/vn/vstorage/object-storage/vstorage-hcm03/cach-tinh-phi) .

## Delete project <a href="#xoa-project" id="xoa-project"></a>

You have created a project with the appropriate hosting package. Now your business needs have changed and you no longer need the project. We recommend that you delete the project to optimize costs.

To delete a project, you can:

1. Log in to [https://vstorage.console.vngcloud.vn](https://vstorage.console.vngcloud.vn/storage/list) .
2. Select the icon ![](https://docs.vngcloud.vn/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F3672463924-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252FB0NrrrdJdpYOYzRkbWp5%252Fuploads%252FkcyUBgpsSXeMN2pcVWWi%252Fimage.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D94a5949b-5b8c-4780-9b32-9fa7175fab46\&width=21\&dpr=4\&quality=100\&sign=f4d132ff\&sv=2)in the project you want to delete. Select **Delete** .
3. Enter the string **delete me** and select **Delete.**

After you delete the project, the deleted project will disappear from your project list. At this time, the deleted project will be in **the Trash** , your deleted project will be stored in **the Trash** for 7 days without any charge. During these 7 days, you can restore the deleted project. To restore, see the instructions in the Restore project section. If after 7 days you do not restore the project, the project and all data inside will be completely deleted from the system and cannot be restored.

If you delete a project before the initial retention period, we will refund you, and if you restore a project, we will also charge you a restore fee. For details on how vStorage charges for project refunds and restores, see How it's Charged.

Because deleting a project is risky, we recommend that you consider carefully and create a backup version of the project before deleting it.

## Create a POC project <a href="#thuc-hien-poc-project" id="thuc-hien-poc-project"></a>

When you are a user on the vStorage system, by default you will not be able to perform POC projects. POC is a program that helps customers experience the service through the value (in credit in the POC wallet) provided by GreenNode to customers. Normally, POC wallets will be granted through promotional programs, promotional campaigns of GreenNode. Thereby, customers can experience creating certain services within a specified period of time. To perform POC projects, please contact the Sales staff or the staff who directly supports you or open a support ticket on our system. The POC wallet granted has a certain value and is used within a specified period of time depending on the company's policy. After the validity period expires, you can request to extend the POC wallet's usage period or pay an additional fee to maintain the service.

Once we confirm that we have provided a POC wallet to your account, to use the POC wallet please follow the instructions below:

<details>

<summary>Create a project using POC wallet balance</summary>

1. Log in to [https://vstorage.console.vngcloud.vn](https://vstorage.console.vngcloud.vn/storage/list) .
2. Select **region HCM04.**
3. Select **Create a project.**
4. **The Create New Project** screen is displayed. In **Project Name** , enter a name that complies with our regulations for your project.
5. Choose a hosting **Quota** according to your needs. Quota is the maximum hosting package size you can create. For each hosting package, we have provided a minimum and maximum size so you can choose to change based on your actual needs.
6. **Turn off the Enable auto-renewal** option. Now we show the **PoC** option.
7. Select **PoC** .
8. Select **Create a project.**
9. Select **Checkout PoC** after reviewing your cart information.

After you complete the 9 steps described above, your project has been created through the payment method of POC wallet. This **project** has the prefix **\[POC]. By default, this project will have a start date as the project creation time and an end date as the expiration date of the POC wallet you were provided.**

The default POC resource usage time coincides with the POC wallet expiration time. We only support you to use the POC wallet to pay for POC resources. For POC resources, the price of POC resource usage is calculated similarly to that of regular resources. For more details, please refer to How to calculate fees.
