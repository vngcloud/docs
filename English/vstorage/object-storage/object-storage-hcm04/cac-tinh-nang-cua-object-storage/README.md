# Features of Object Storage

In the HCM04 region of vStorage, an object is a file and any metadata that describes that file. A bucket is a container for objects. To store your data in vStorage, you first create a project and specify the project name and storage package through the vStorage Portal. You then need to use 3rd party softwares to connect and create one or more buckets on top of the newly created project. At this point, you upload your object to that bucket as an object in vStorage. The vStorage storage organization model is described below.
