# Rclone

## Overview <a href="#rclone-tongquan" id="rclone-tongquan"></a>

Rclone is a command line interface for managing files in the cloud. Rclone can be used as a feature-rich alternative to cloud providers' storage management interfaces. More than 40 cloud storage products support Rclone, including S3 object stores, personal and enterprise file hosting services, and standard file transfer protocols.

Rclone has powerful cloud commands that are equivalent to unix commands rsync, cp, mv, mount, ls, ncdu, tree, rm, and cat. Rclone's familiar syntax also supports shell pipelines.

To help you quickly install and configure this user tool, we provide an integration feature through the vStorage Portal. You just need to provide the correct Region, Project, vStorage credentials and then download the configuration file for Rclone, which can be used to access your resources on the vStorage service. After accessing your resources (projects, buckets, objects, etc.) on the vStorage service, to work with these resources using the Rclone tool, you can refer to more use cases or features of Rclone to work with vStorage resources.
