**Attention:**

* Do not use an old/new version of Cyberduck on operating systems with an old/new version because errors may occur.
* When you use Cyberduck to Copy/ Move/ Rename objects on the vStorage system, it may cause errors. We recommend that you do not use these features.
* Cyberduck does not support cleaning incomplete segments when uploading large objects (Multipart upload). When you use Cyberduck (s3, swift) to upload large files (multipart upload), the file is divided into multiple segments to upload to the vStorage system. During the file upload process, some segments may be uploaded, some segments may not be uploaded due to errors such as network problems, vStorage system overload, your Cyberduck stops running, hangs, etc. The file is then considered as an unsuccessful upload, the uploaded segments are considered as incomplete segments or garbage segments and are occupying your storage space. Currently, Cyberduck does not support cleaning these garbage segments. Therefore, we recommend that you consider carefully before using this tool.
