# S3 SDK

## Overview <a href="#s3sdk-tongquan" id="s3sdk-tongquan"></a>

VNG Cloud's vStorage product provides the S3 SDK to make it easier to integrate your software applications with vStorage. The S3 SDK simplifies your programming tasks by packaging S3 REST APIs into features in various programming languages. S3 SDK software development kits are available for many popular programming languages. Each SDK provides a feature set, sample source code, and documentation to help developers build applications in their preferred language more easily.

To help you quickly install and configure this user tool, we provide an integration feature through the vStorage Portal. You just need to provide the correct Region, Project, vStorage credentials and then download the configuration file for the S3 SDK, which can be used to access your resources on the vStorage storage service. For details, please refer to Integrating the S3 SDK with vStorage. After accessing your resources (projects, containers, objects, etc.) on the vStorage service, to work with these resources using the S3 SDK, you can refer to more use cases or features of the S3 SDK to work with vStorage resources. For details, please refer to Using the S3 SDK
