S3 Browser is an optimized browser that allows users to share and upload their files. This tool has a relatively simple interface, is easy to use, and is compatible with the vStorage storage service API.

To integrate the S3 Browser tool with vStorage, you need to collect Region, Project, and vStorage credentials yourself. For details, see Integrating the S3 Browser tool with vStorage. After accessing your resources (projects, buckets, objects, etc.) on the vStorage service, to work with these resources, you can refer to more use cases or features of the S3 Browser to work with vStorage resources. For details, see Using the S3 Browser tool.
