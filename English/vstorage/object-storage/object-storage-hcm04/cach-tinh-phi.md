# Charging Fee

We currently support 2 types of users: prepaid and postpaid with 1 type of storage package: **Instant Archive Type** . When you create a new project, we support you to change the quota of the storage package to a certain value.

* Initially, when you successfully register for a VNG Cloud account, we classify you as a prepaid user by default. That means you need to pay for a storage package before you can use the service and the storage package will have a duration depending on the cycle you choose.
* If you have the need and ensure some conditions on spending indicators, we can support the conversion of user form from prepaid to postpaid. That means you do not need to pay when purchasing a storage package, the monthly invoice value will be calculated based on the actual capacity, requests,... that you use.

You can choose the appropriate form to optimize your or your unit's storage costs. For more details, please refer to: [Manage invoices, costs & resources on VNG Cloud](https://docs.vngcloud.vn/vng-cloud-document/v/vn/quan-ly-hoa-don-chi-phi-and-tai-nguyen-tren-vng-cloud) .

In addition, when you delete a project during the active cycle of the project you purchased before, we will refund you the actual amount based on the number of resources you have not used in the paid cycle.
