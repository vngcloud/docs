# Delete S3 key, Swift user

To delete one or more S3 keys or Swift users that you created earlier, follow the instructions below:

1\. Log in to [https://iam.console.vngcloud.vn/](https://iam.console.vngcloud.vn/]\(https://iam.console.vngcloud.vn/\)) with your Root User Account.\
2\. Select the **vStorage Credentials** section.\
3\. From the list of existing S3 keys and Swift users, choose one or more that you want to delete.\
4\. Click **Delete**.

From the moment S3 keys or Swift users are successfully deleted, you won't be able to use these credentials to access vStorage. Exercise caution when performing the delete operation, as deleted accounts cannot be recovered.
