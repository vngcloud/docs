# Delete an IAM User Account

To delete an IAM User Account that was created earlier, follow the instructions below:

1\. Log in to [https://iam.console.vngcloud.vn/](https://iam.console.vngcloud.vn/]\(https://iam.console.vngcloud.vn/\)) using your Root User Account.\
2\. Select the **User Account** menu.\
3\. From the list of existing IAM User Accounts, choose one or more IAM User Accounts that you want to delete.\
4\. Select **Delete**.

Once the IAM User Account is successfully deleted, you won't be able to use this IAM User Account to access vStorage. Exercise caution when performing the deletion operation as deleted accounts cannot be recovered.
