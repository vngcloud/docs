# Managing vStorage access account

You can use three types of accounts to access vStorage. Details of these three types include:

* **Root User Account:** This is the initial account created to access VNG Cloud with full access rights to all resource services on VNG Cloud.
* **IAM User Account (User Account):** This account is created from the unique Root User Account, with access rights depending on the access policies established from the Root User Account.
* **Service Account:** This account is used by an application/machine to execute API calls that are authorized and access specified resources on VNG Cloud.
