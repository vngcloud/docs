# Access Permissions and Working Through IAM User Account

To access your resources on the vStorage storage service, you can use various channels such as vStorage Portal, vStorage API, Swift Rest API, S3 Rest API, and Swift/S3 client tools. For vStorage Portal, you can use the IAM User Account to log in. If you don't have an IAM User Account, please refer to IAM User Account.

Follow the steps below to log in to vStorage with the IAM User Account:

1\. Access the vStorage service login page: [https://signin.vngcloud.vn](https://signin.vngcloud.vn/).

2\. The main login page will appear. Choose **LOGIN WITH IAM USER ACCOUNT.**

3\. Enter the **email** address of the Root user when registering the VNG Cloud account.

4\. Enter the **username** and **password** of the IAM user account created in the vIAM system.

5\. Choose **LOGIN WITH IAM USER ACCOUNT**. If you have previously logged in as an IAM user account in this browser, your browser may remember the IAM user account address. If so, you will see the screen displayed in step 3. After successfully logging in with the IAM user account, the main screen of vStorage will show the type of user you are using to log in (Root user account or IAM user account).

6\. After successfully logging in, you have the right to access and perform the features provided by the vStorage service on the resources assigned to you. For details on the features supported by vStorage, please refer to vStorage Features. If your IAM user account has not been granted permission to perform the features of the vStorage service on the resources, please refer to [IAM User Account](https://docs.vngcloud.vn/display/VSEN/IAM+User+Account)
