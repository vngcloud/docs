# Charging Fee

Currently, we support two types of users: prepaid and postpaid, with three storage packages: Gold, Silver, Archive. When you create a new project, you need to choose one storage package, and we assist you in changing the quota of the storage package to a certain value.

* Initially, upon the successful registration of your GreenNode account, we categorize you as a prepaid user. This means you need to pay for the storage package before being able to use the service, and the storage package will have a duration depending on the selected cycle.
* If you have the need and meet certain performance metrics, we can assist in transitioning users from prepaid to postpaid. In other words, you don't need to pay when purchasing the storage package, and the monthly invoice will be calculated based on the actual usage, including storage capacity, requests, etc.

You can choose the payment method that suits your storage cost optimization needs for your organization. For more details, please refer to: Billing, Fees & Resources Management on GreenNode.

Furthermore, when you delete a project within its valid cycle that you previously purchased, we will refund you the actual amount based on the unused resources in the paid cycle. For more information, please refer to: Billing, Fees & Resources Management on GreenNode.
