# Usecase

vStorage can be used for various storage needs. Here are some common applications:

**Media hosting applications:**

* **Static file storage for the web:** Static data such as images, HTML, and documents can be stored on vStorage to reduce the load on server disks, saving costs and improving user experience.
* **Video and image storage for CDN (Content Delivery Network):** vStorage Gold/Silver class is designed to handle the request volume from CDNs or end users. Additionally, with upload/download bandwidth of up to 10Gbps in each direction, your original storage will never be congested, even if the number of users increases dramatically.
* **Backup storage:** Silver and Archive are two storage classes suitable for backup data needs due to their large bandwidth, making it easy to upload backup data quickly. vStorage's autoscaling capability helps minimize the risk of running out of backup storage space and addresses the challenges of rapid data growth.

**Mount storage as a network drive:**

One of the common applications of vStorage is to mount it as a network disk on a server or client. This allows most applications that are running to easily transfer data without having to spend time learning about application compatibility or making adjustments for use.

**Software delivery:**

vStorage can be used to host apps, content, and game clients for users to download. With vStorage's large infrastructure, you don't need to worry about congestion when the number of downloads increases dramatically.

**File server storage applications:**

For centralized storage with shared permissions in the cloud, the simplest way is to build a server gateway with vStorage. The server gateway acts as an intermediary for data transfer, meeting fast access requirements thanks to the server-side cache, while the main data is stored in vStorage to optimize storage costs.
