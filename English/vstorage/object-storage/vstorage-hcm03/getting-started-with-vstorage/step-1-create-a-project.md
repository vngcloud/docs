# Step 1: Create a project

To start using the service, you need to create a project. A Project is a term on vStorage that represents a storage package with a specific capacity that you purchase on VNG Cloud. At any given time, you can own one or multiple projects concurrently and use them as a way to organize resources for different groups or departments with different purposes.

Follow these steps to create a project:

1. Log in to [https://vstorage.console.vngcloud.vn](https://vstorage.console.vngcloud.vn/). If you don't have an account, sign up for free [here](https://chat.openai.com/c/link).
2. Choose the storage **Region**.
3. Select **Create a Project**.
4. Enter the **Project Name** and choose the appropriate **Project Type** (storage package) according to your needs.
5. Choose the desired **Quota** (storage capacity).
6. Complete the **Checkout** steps, and the **Project** will be initiated.

For convenience, we recommend using the name of your project or business product as the **Project Name** in vStorage.

Additionally, we are supporting 3 available storage packages:

* Gold: Suitable for storing media, serving as originals for CDN, with a large number of accessors.
* Silver: Suitable for backup storage, data with not too much access.
* Archive: Suitable for long-term storage needs, minimum 6 months, low usage.

The storage cost calculation for each project is publicly available on the VNG Cloud homepage, see [Charging Fee](https://docs.vngcloud.vn/display/VSEN/Charging+Fee).
