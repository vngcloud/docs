# Step 6: Delete the object and container

When you no longer need an object or container, we encourage you to delete them to avoid incurring costs. Before you delete your container, please delete the objects within the container.

After you have deleted your objects and containers, they will no longer exist. If you want to continue using the same container name, we recommend you delete the objects but not the container. After you delete a container, that container's name will be available for reuse.

1. Log in to [https://vstorage.console.vngcloud.vn](https://vstorage.console.vngcloud.vn/). Choose the **project** and **container** that contains the object you want to delete.
2. Select ![image2023-3-6\_9-53-5.png](https://docs.vngcloud.vn/download/attachments/49648424/image2023-3-6\_9-53-5.png?version=1\&modificationDate=1678071186000\&api=v2) at the **containers** or **objects** you want to delete.

We will delete the selected container or object. If you choose to delete a container, this action will delete all folders and objects within the container. After the deletion process is complete, you cannot recover the deleted data. Please note that this action may take time to complete depending on the size or number of objects in the container.
