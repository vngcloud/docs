# Move objects

You have uploaded an object to a container. At this point, you realize that the object you just uploaded is not in the correct container or directory you intended. Instead of having to delete the object and upload it to another container or directory, we provide you with the feature to move the object.

To move objects, follow the instructions below:

&#x20;Sử dụng vStorage Portal

1\. Login to [https://vstorage.console.vngcloud.vn](https://vstorage.console.vngcloud.vn/).

2\. Choose the **project**, **container**, and then select the **objects** you want to move.

3\.

4\. Select the destination **container** and **directory** (if applicable) where you want to move the object. We also support creating a new directory if the desired directory does not already exist.

You can move objects between containers within a project. Currently, we do not support moving objects between different projects.

&#x20;Use vStorage API

In addition to the traditional management interface, we also provide an API that allows you to integrate with your user-facing applications and tools with vStorage for data storage.

To move objects via vStorage API, please refer to the [API developers](https://docs.vngcloud.vn/display/VSEN/API+developers).

***

&#x20;Use 3rd party softwares

vStorage is also compatible with user-side tools using the S3 protocol. You can easily use familiar tools such as Rclone, s3cmd, Cyberduck, and more.

To move objects via 3rd party software, please refer to the [3rd Party Softwares](https://docs.vngcloud.vn/display/VSEN/3rd+Party+Softwares).
