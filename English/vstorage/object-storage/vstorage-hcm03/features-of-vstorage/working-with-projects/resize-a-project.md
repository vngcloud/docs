# Resize a project

You have initiated a project with an initial quota that suits your storage needs. Currently, your business requirements have changed, and the existing capacity is no longer sufficient. To address this issue, you can adjust the storage quota through the Change Quota feature that we provide.

To change the quota for a project, you can:

&#x20;Use vStorage Portal

1. Log in to [https://vstorage.console.vngcloud.vn](https://vstorage.console.vngcloud.vn/).
2. Select the icon ![image2023-3-6\_10-2-51.png](https://docs.vngcloud.vn/download/attachments/49648497/image2023-3-6\_10-2-51.png?version=1\&modificationDate=1678071772000\&api=v2) for the **project** where you want to modify the quota. Choose ![](https://docs.vngcloud.vn/download/thumbnails/67994039/image2023-11-21\_13-48-10.png?version=1\&modificationDate=1700549292000\&api=v2).
3. The **Resize project** screen appears. Choose the desired storage **quota** to increase, the storage **quota** you can increase or decrease to the maximum or minimum level provided by the storage package. You cannot adjust the storage **quota** below or exceed this value.
4. Select **Resize**.
5. Select **Checkout** after reviewing the shopping cart and payment method.
6. Select **Continue to pay** and proceed with the payment after choosing the appropriate payment method. For more information on the storage packages we offer, see [Charging Fee](https://docs.vngcloud.vn/display/VSEN/Charging+Fee).

After successfully completing these 6 steps, the new total quota value after the change will be updated in the general information of the selected project.

&#x20;Use vStorage API

In addition to the traditional management interface portal, we also provide APIs that allow you to integrate vStorage with your user-facing applications and tools for data storage.

To resize a project through the vStorage API, please refer to the [API developers page.](https://docs.vngcloud.vn/display/VSEN/API+developers)
