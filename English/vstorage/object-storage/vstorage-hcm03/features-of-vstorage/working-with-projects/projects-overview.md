# Projects overview

To upload your data (images, videos, documents, etc.) to vStorage, you first need to create a project in one of the regions we provide. After a project is created, the name of that project cannot be used by the same VNG Cloud account inside or outside a region until the project is deleted. We recommend using the name of your project or business product as the name of the storage project in vStorage. For naming principles for projects, see Project naming limitations.

A project is where containers are stored in vStorage. You can have up to 10 projects in each region in your account. Each project includes a user group and a storage package. If your storage needs exceed 10 projects, we can also support you in increasing this number. To request an increase, visit Resource Limits and follow the instructions.

Currently, we support regions in geographical areas: Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City. You can also request us to provide a special region if your needs go beyond these 2 regions. To optimize latency, minimize costs, or address regulatory requirements, choose any region close to you geographically. For example, if you reside in Hanoi, you may find it convenient to create a project in the HN01 region.

In terms of deployment, projects, containers, and objects are resources of vStorage, and we also provide APIs for you to manage them. For example, you can create a project, container, and upload objects using the API. You can also use the administration interface we provide or 3rd-party software to perform these operations.

This section describes how to work with projects. For information on working with projects, see [Working with projects](https://docs.vngcloud.vn/display/VSEN/Working+with+projects).
