# Restore a project

You have just deleted a project or a project with expired storage. At this point, the project will be moved to the Trash folder and stored here for 7 days. After 7 days, the project will be permanently deleted and cannot be recovered. During this 7-day period, if you realize that you deleted it by mistake or you want to continue using a project with expired storage, we provide you with the feature to restore the deleted project.

To restore a deleted project, you can:

&#x20;Use vStorage Portal

1. Log in to [https://vstorage.console.vngcloud.vn](https://vstorage.console.vngcloud.vn/).
2. &#x20;Select the **Trash** menu.
3. Click on the icon ![](https://docs.vngcloud.vn/download/thumbnails/67994059/image2023-2-2\_16-30-26.png?version=1\&modificationDate=1700622290000\&api=v2) for the **project** you want to restore.
4. Choose the storage **period** you want to restore. We provide storage periods including 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, 24 months, and 36 months. When you choose the restoration period, the system will automatically calculate the effective time of the new storage period and the total amount you need to pay for project renewal.
5. Click **Restore**.
6. Choose **Checkout** after reviewing the shopping cart and the payment method.
7. Select **Continue Payment** and proceed with the payment after choosing the appropriate payment method.

For more information on the storage packages we offer, see [Charging Fee](https://docs.vngcloud.vn/display/VSEN/Charging+Fee).

After successfully completing the 7 steps above, the project will be restored with the updated storage period information and reflected in the general information of the selected project.

When a project is placed in the Trash, you will no longer be able to upload/download or perform actions on objects. We recommend extending or backing up all data in the project before the expiration date.

&#x20;Use vStorage API

In addition to the traditional management interface portal, we also provide APIs that allow you to integrate vStorage with your user-facing applications and tools for data storage.

To restore a project through the vStorage API, please refer to the [API developers page.](https://docs.vngcloud.vn/display/VSEN/API+developers)
