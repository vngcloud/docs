# Renew a project

You have initiated a project with a short-term storage period. Currently, your business needs have changed, and you want to extend this storage period. To address this issue, you can adjust the storage period through the renew feature provided by us.

To renew a project, you can:

&#x20;Use vStorage Portal

1. Log in to [https://vstorage.console.vngcloud.vn](https://vstorage.console.vngcloud.vn/).
2. Select the icon ![](https://docs.vngcloud.vn/download/thumbnails/67994045/image2023-3-6\_10-6-56.png?version=1\&modificationDate=1700549566000\&api=v2) for the **project** you want to renew. Choose **Renew**.
3. Choose the desired storage **period** for renewal. We offer storage period including: 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, 24 months, 36 months. When you select the renewal period, the system will automatically calculate the effective time of the new storage period and the total amount you need to pay for renewing the **project**.
4. Select **Checkout** after reviewing the shopping cart and payment method.
5. Select **Continue** to pay and proceed with the payment after choosing the appropriate payment method. For more information on the storage packages we offer, see [Charging Fee](https://docs.vngcloud.vn/display/VSEN/Charging+Fee).

After successfully completing these 6 steps, the new storage period after renewing the project will be updated in the general information of the selected project.
