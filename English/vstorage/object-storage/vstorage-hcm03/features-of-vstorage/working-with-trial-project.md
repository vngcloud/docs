# Working with trial project

When you are a new user on the vStorage, by default we will turn off the **Create a trial project** feature. To enable the **Create a trial project** feature, please contact your Sales or support staff directly or open a support ticket on our system. We define a trial project as a project that you can initiate without direct payment. You can experience using the trial project within 7 days, this trial project will have full features like a normal project.

After we confirm your account has been trial enabled, to create a trial project, follow the instructions below:

&#x20;Create a trial project

1\. Log in to [https://vstorage.console.vngcloud.vn](https://vstorage.console.vngcloud.vn/).

2\. Select the **region** you want to store data in.

Choose a region near you to minimize latency and costs and address regulatory requirements. Objects stored in a region will never leave that region unless you move them to another region. For a list of vStorage regions, see [Resource Quota](https://docs.vngcloud.vn/display/VSEN/Resource+Quota).

3\. Select **Create a project**.

The **Create new project screen** is displayed.

4\. In **Project name**, enter a name that complies with our regulations for your project.

After creating a project, you cannot change the name of the project. For more information about project naming, see Project scope limitations.

5\. Select **Project type** (hosting package) according to your needs.

We offer you 3 storage packages Gold, Silver, Archive to suit your different data storage needs. For more information about the hosting plans we offer, see How we charge.

6\. Select **Storage Quota** according to your needs.

Quota is the maximum storage package size you can create. For each hosting package, we have provided a minimum and maximum size so you can choose to change based on your actual needs.

7\. Select **Create a project**.

After you complete the 7 steps described above, the trial project has been created. You can create up to one trial project on one VNG Cloud account. We clearly show the remaining days you can use the project on the list of projects you have.

After 7 days of using the trial project, if you do not convert this trial project to a regular project, we will completely delete your trial project from the system. During the 7 days of using the trial project, you can convert this trial project to your regular project according to the instructions below.

3\. The **Buy resource screen** is displayed. Select the **Storage Period** desired to purchase. We offer storage periods including: 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, 24 months, 36 months. When you select Renewal period, the system will automatically calculate the validity period of the new storage period and the total amount you need to pay to convert the trial project to a regular project.

4\. Select **Buy Now.**

5\. Select **Checkout** after checking the cart and payment method.

6\. Select **Continue to Checkout** and make your payment after selecting the appropriate payment method.

After you successfully complete the above 6 steps, your trial project will be converted into a regular project and this information will be updated on the general information of the project you choose.
