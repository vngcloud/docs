# Features of vStorage

vStorage is a service for storing objects in containers. An object is a file and any metadata describing that file. A container is a receptacle for objects. To store your data in vStorage, you first create a project and specify the project name, storage package, and the region where you want to store data. Then, you create a container within the newly created project, specifying the container name. At this point, you upload your objects to that container as objects in vStorage. The storage organization model of vStorage is described below."
