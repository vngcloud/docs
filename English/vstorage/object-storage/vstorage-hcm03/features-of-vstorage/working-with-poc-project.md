# Working with POC project

When you are a user on a vStorage system, by default you will not be able to perform POC projects. POC is a program that helps customers experience the service through the value (in credits in POC wallet) provided to customers by VNG Cloud. Normally, POC wallets will be issued through promotions, promotion campaigns of VNG Cloud. Thereby, customers can experience creating certain services for themselves within the specified time. To implement a POC project, please contact the Sales staff or support staff directly for you or open a support ticket on our system. The issued POC wallet has a certain value that will be used for the specified period of time depending on the company's policy. At the end of the validity period, you can request an extension of the POC wallet expiry date or pay an additional cost to maintain the service.

Once we confirm that a POC wallet has been provisioned for your account, to use a POC wallet follow the instructions below:

&#x20;Create a project using POC wallet balances

1\. Log in to [https://vstorage.console.vngcloud.vn](https://vstorage.console.vngcloud.vn/).

2\. Select the **region** you want to store data in.

Choose a region near you to minimize latency and costs and address regulatory requirements. Objects stored in a region will never leave that region unless you move them to another region. For a list of vStorage regions, see Resource Limits.

3\. Select **Create a project.**

The **Create new project screen** is displayed.

4\. In **Project name**, enter a name that complies with our regulations for your project.

After creating a project, you cannot change the name of the project. For more information about project naming, see Project scope limitations.

5\. Select **Project type** according to your needs.

We offer you 3 storage packages Gold, Silver, Archive to suit your different data storage needs. For more information about the hosting plans we offer, see How we charge.

6\. Select **Storage Quota** according to your needs.

Quota is the maximum storage package size you can create. For each hosting package, we have provided a minimum and maximum size so you can choose to change based on your actual needs.

7\. Turn off **Enable automatic renewal**. We now display the **PoC** selection.

8\. Select **PoC**.

9\. Select **Create a project**.

10\. Select **Checkout** PoC after checking cart information.

After you complete the 10 steps described above, your project has been created through the POC wallet payment method. This project is prefixed with \[POC]. By default, this project will have a start date that is the project creation time and an end date that is the expiration time of the POC wallet you are provided.

The default POC resource usage time coincides with the POC wallet end time. We only support you to use POC wallets to pay for POC resources. For POC resources, the price calculation for using POC resources is similar to that of regular resources. For more details, please refer to [Charging Fee](https://docs.vngcloud.vn/display/VSEN/Charging+Fee).
