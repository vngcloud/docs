# Security

VNG Cloud is responsible for ensuring the security of the physical and virtual infrastructure that it provides for its services. In addition, VNG also provides services that allow customers to deploy their own security functions for their systems hosted at VNG Cloud.

Security is a top priority at VNG Cloud. VNG Cloud customers will benefit from the most standard security standards for organizations and businesses. The responsibility for security will lie with both VNG Cloud and the customer, including the following customer responsibilities:

* Manage access to customer storage resources by managing access permissions to customer storage resources.
* Manage user account access information such as **username** and **password**.
* Grant appropriate system access permissions based on IAM for customer resources at VNG Cloud.

To protect customer information and data that customers store on the vStorage service, the following security controls are currently in place:

* **Access control**: VNG Cloud uses IAM to manage user access to vStorage resources. IAM allows businesses to create and manage access policies for each vStorage resource. This helps ensure that only those with the necessary access can access the data.
* **Data in transit security**: VNG Cloud uses HTTPS to encrypt data in transit. HTTPS is a secure protocol based on HTTP that uses TLS/SSL encryption to protect data during transmission.
* **Data security stored on vStorage**: VNG Cloud provides two mechanisms for content encryption of files (objects) stored on the vStorage service:
  * **Client-side encryption**: In this mechanism, the user is responsible for managing the key and workload of the encryption process. Data will be encrypted on the user's server or application layer.

VNG Cloud is always striving to improve its security measures to ensure the safety of customer data.
