# What is vStorage?

vStorage - VNG Cloud Storage is a storage service based on Object Storage architecture, aiming to build an efficient, secure, and scalable storage solution for storing tens to hundreds of terabytes of data without service interruption and meeting the need for fast data access (milliseconds). Customers of all sizes and industries can use vStorage to store and protect data for various use cases, such as media repositories, websites, mobile applications, enterprise applications, IoT devices, and analytical data. vStorage provides advanced management features, allowing you to proactively optimize cost as well as performance, organize data, and establish access permissions as required by the organization.

vStorage offers three storage tiers: Gold, Silver, and Archive. With the Gold storage tier, your data is always ready for use with the ability to respond to access requests in milliseconds. The Silver tier is suitable for infrequently accessed data, ensuring that the data is always ready for use at any time with low storage costs. Lastly, Archive is the most cost-effective storage tier suitable for very rarely accessed data but needs to be stored, such as medical records, transaction logs, etc.
