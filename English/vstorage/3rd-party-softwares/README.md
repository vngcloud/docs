During the file download process, some segments may be uploaded, some segments may not be uploaded due to errors such as network problems, upload > 1000 segments, your user tool stops running, hanging, etc. The file is then considered an unsuccessful upload, uploaded segments are considered incomplete segments or junk segments and are taking up your storage space.</li><li>You can choose a number of user-side tools that support cleaning these junk segments to clean them up and free up storage space. List of user tools that support cleaning junk segments and cleaning instructions, please refer to <a href="https://docs.vngcloud.vn/display/VSEN/3rd+Party+Softwares">3rd Party Softwares</a>.</li><li>At this time, vStorage does not support the feature of cleaning up these junk segments. We are considering a solution for future support. Currently, if there is a problem related to garbage segments, we recommend that you use the garbage cleaning solution of client tools.</li></ul> |

#### Using 3rd Party Software <a href="#id-3rdpartysoftwares-using3rdpartysoftware" id="id-3rdpartysoftwares-using3rdpartysoftware"></a>

To use 3rd party software, you need to provide authentication information for these tools to access the vStorage storage service. You can use the Service Account identity to authenticate when accessing vStorage resources through the mentioned tools. To use a Service Account, you need to initialize S3 keys and a Swift account through the vIAM service, please refer to [Service Account](https://docs.vngcloud.vn/display/VSEN/Service+Account).

After initializing S3 keys and a Swift account through the vIAM service, collect the following information to use as authentication details when accessing the vStorage service. If you don't have this information, please contact your VNG Cloud account administrator.

* Information for S3 key includes access key, secret key, project, and restriction by IAM (if applicable).
* Information for the Swift account includes username, password, project, and restriction by IAM (if applicable).
* Service Account details include username, Client ID, and Client Secret.

You can find the configuration information for a created Service Account on the vIAM system. For more information, see [IAM for vStorage](https://docs.vngcloud.vn/display/ONVINA/IAM+for+vStorage)

To access the vStorage storage service using the collected authentication information, refer to the detailed instructions for each tool in the topics below.
