# Cyberduck

#### Overview <a href="#cyberduck-overview" id="cyberduck-overview"></a>

Cyberduck is an open-source client application for FTP, SFTP, WebDAV, and cloud storage, available for macOS and Windows and licensed under GPL. Cyberduck is written in Java and C#, using the Cocoa user interface framework on macOS and Windows Forms on Windows.

To facilitate quick installation and configuration of this user tool, we offer an integration feature through the vStorage Portal. You only need to provide accurate Region, Project, and authentication information (vStorage credentials). Afterward, download the configuration file for Cyberduck, enabling you to access your resources on the vStorage storage service. Once you have gained access to your resources (project, container, object, etc.) on the vStorage service, you can refer to various use cases or features of Cyberduck to work with these resources effectively. For detailed instructions on integrating Cyberduck with vStorage, please refer to [Integrating Cyberduck with vStorage](https://docs-admin.vngcloud.vn/display/VSEN/Integrating+Cyberduck+with+vStorage?src=contextnavpagetreemode). After accessing your resources on the vStorage service, you can explore additional use cases or features of Cyberduck in [Using Cyberduck](https://docs-admin.vngcloud.vn/display/VSEN/Using+Cyberduck?src=contextnavpagetreemode).
