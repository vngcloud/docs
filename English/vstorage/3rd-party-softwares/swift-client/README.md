# Swift Client

#### Overview <a href="#swiftclient-overview" id="swiftclient-overview"></a>

SwiftClient is a command-line interface (CLI) user tool written in Python, allowing you to interact with the vStorage storage service through Swift Restful APIs.

To facilitate quick installation and configuration of this user tool, we offer an integration feature through the vStorage Portal. You only need to provide accurate Region, Project, and authentication information (vStorage credentials). Afterward, download the configuration file for SwiftClient, enabling you to access your resources on the vStorage storage service. Once you have gained access to your resources (project, container, object, etc.) on the vStorage service, you can refer to various use cases or features of SwiftClient to work with these resources effectively. For detailed instructions on integrating SwiftClient with vStorage, please refer to [Integrating SwiftClient with vStorage](https://docs-admin.vngcloud.vn/display/VSEN/Integrating+SwiftClient+with+vStorage?src=contextnavpagetreemode). After accessing your resources on the vStorage service, you can explore additional use cases or features of SwiftClient in [Using Swift Client](https://docs-admin.vngcloud.vn/display/VSEN/Using+Swift+Client?src=contextnavpagetreemode).
