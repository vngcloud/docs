#### Overview <a href="#s3browser-overview" id="s3browser-overview"></a>

S3 Browser is an optimized browser that allows users to share and upload their files. This tool has a relatively simple and user-friendly interface and is compatible with the API of the vStorage storage service.

To integrate the S3 Browser tool with vStorage, you need to collect information about the Region, Project, and credentials (vStorage credentials). For more details, please refer to [Integrating S3 Browser with vStorage](https://docs-admin.vngcloud.vn/display/VSEN/Integrating+S3+Browser+with+vStorage?src=contextnavpagetreemode). After accessing your resources (project, container, object, etc.) on the vStorage service, you can explore additional use cases or features of S3 Browser to work with vStorage resources. For more details, please refer to [Using S3 Browser](https://docs-admin.vngcloud.vn/display/VSEN/Using+S3+Browser?src=contextnavpagetreemode).
