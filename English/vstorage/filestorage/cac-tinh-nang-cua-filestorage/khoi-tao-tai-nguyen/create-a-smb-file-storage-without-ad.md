# Create a SMB File Storage without AD

To create an SMB (Server Message Block) without Active Directory on the File Storage system, you can follow these steps:

## Create a Windows server on vServer <a href="#khoi-tao-windows-server-on-vserver" id="khoi-tao-windows-server-on-vserver"></a>

Below is a basic guide for initializing Windows server on vServer, if you already have a server, skip this step.

<summary>Instructions for creating Windows server</summary>

Before you can perform Windows server initialization, make sure you initialize VPC, Subnet on the vServer system. Next, follow the steps below to initialize Windows server:

1. Log in to vServer at [https://hcm-03.console.vngcloud.tech/vserver](https://hcm-03.console.vngcloud.tech/vserver/v-server/create-server) .
2. Continue to select **Servers** .
3. Select **Create a Server.**
4. In the **Basic Configuration** section , enter **the Server name** to describe the name for your Server. The Server name can consist of letters (az, AZ, 0-9, '\_', '-'). The input data length is between 5 and 50. It cannot contain leading or trailing spaces and the Server name must be different from the Username.
5. Select **the Zone** where you want to create the server.
6. **Enter Tag** information including **Key** / **Value** for the server and click **Add** to add this tag if you need.
7. Select **OS Images: Windows,** continue to select **Window version** depending on your usage needs.
8. Under **Instance type,** there is a list of Flavor configurations, you can choose the desired Flavor configuration for your Server according to. **iot.v1.small1x1** is recommended by us as a default basic configuration to initialize the Server
9. In **Volume Settings** , enter the configuration for Boot OS Volume (Root) including **Size GB** , **Volume Type SSD** and **IOPS** , then select **Next.**
10. In addition, you can add **Data Volume** to the Server during the initialization process by selecting **Add Data volume,** then **enter** the configuration for the Data Volume including **Volume name** , **Size GB** , **Volume Type SSD** and **IOPS** , select **Next.**
11. **Next, select the Network settings** parameter : Here you can select **VPC** to assign Private IP to Server and **Subnet** from the list you created earlier, or you can click [**here**](https://hcm-3.console.vngcloud.vn/vserver/network/vpc) to create a new VPC and Subnet. Note that after creating VPC and Subnet, it will be displayed on the list page for you to choose during Server initialization:
    1. Check the Floating IP box to assign Public IP to the Server (Click [**here**](https://docs.vngcloud.vn/vng-cloud-document/vn/vserver/compute-hcm03-1a/network/floating-ip) to see instructions for attaching/ detach Floating IP)
    2. **Security group** to manage ACL - Access Control List for Server. (Click [**here**](https://docs.vngcloud.vn/vng-cloud-document/vn/vserver/compute-hcm03-1a/security/security-groups) to see instructions for creating and managing Security group)
12. **Enter Authentication** information : Empty: the system will automatically generate and attach a password or the user can manually adjust and enable or disable skipping the first password change.
13. In **Other Settings** , you can choose Server Group or not according to your needs. You can assign Server to previously created Groups (With properties such as same Compute Host or different Compute Host)
14. Select **Launch Server** and follow the payment steps to complete the server initialization.

## Connect to the  Windows server <a href="#ket-noi-toi-windows-server-vua-khoi-tao" id="ket-noi-toi-windows-server-vua-khoi-tao"></a>

Below is a basic guide for connecting to Windows server on vServer, if you have used Console directly on vServer Portal, please skip this step.

<details>

<summary>Connect to Windows server</summary>

**To be able to connect to a Windows server, you first need to install RDP:** By default, Windows includes an RDP Client. To verify, type **mstsc** at the Command Prompt window. If your computer does not recognize this command, check the Windows home page and search for a download for the [Microsoft Remote Desktop](https://www.microsoft.com/vi-vn/windows) application .

1. Access the Server management page in our driver at: [https://hcm-3.console.vngcloud.vn/vserver/v-server/cloud-server](https://hcm-3.console.vngcloud.vn/vserver/v-server/cloud-server)
2. Select **the Server** you want to connect to, then select **Action, then select Connect.**
3. On the **Connect to Server** page , select **the RDP (Window) tab**

![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (11).png>)

4. Select **Download RDP File** . Your browser will prompt you to open or save the RDP file. When you've finished downloading the file, select **Done** to return to the server page:

5) Open the downloaded file to remote to Windows server. Select **Connect** to continue connecting to your server.

![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (12).png>)

6. The administrator account is selected by default. You need to copy and paste the password you saved earlier into the login pop-up (This information is taken from the email), in which enter the information **InstanceLogin** into **Username** , **InstancePassword** into **Password.**

7) Select **OK.** Due to the nature of self-signed certificates, you may receive a warning that the security certificate cannot be validated. Use the following steps to verify the identity of the remote computer, or simply select **Yes** (Windows) or **Continue** (Mac OS X) if you trust the certificate.
