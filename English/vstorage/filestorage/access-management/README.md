# Access Management

## Access account <a href="#tai-khoan-truy-cap" id="tai-khoan-truy-cap"></a>

On the File Storage system, you can use 2 types of accounts to access File Storage. Details of these 2 types include:

* **Root user account: Is the** [first initial](https://register.vngcloud.vn/signup) account to access VNG Cloud with full access to all resource services on VNG Cloud.
* **IAM user account:** Is an account created through the IAM system and used to operate through the File Storage Portal.

### Root user account <a href="#root-user-account" id="root-user-account"></a>

#### **Create Root User Account**

To create a Root user account, please register an account at the registration page [https://register.vngcloud.vn/signup](https://register.vngcloud.vn/signup) .

After you create a Root user account, you collect the following information to access and work with resources using the Root user account:

* The email address used to create the Root user account.
* Password for the Root user account.

#### **Cancel Root User Account**

To cancel your Root account, you need to contact us by creating a ticket to request account cancellation. For more details, see [Account Cancellation Instructions](https://docs.vngcloud.vn/vng-cloud-document/v/vn/huong-dan-su-dung-tai-khoan/huong-dan-huy-tai-khoan) .

The IAM User Account name should not contain sensitive information (e.g. IP address, login password, etc.) and the IAM User Account name must be unique on a VNG Cloud account until that IAM User Account is deleted. For example, the following IAM User Account name is valid: IAM\_Phong\_kinh\_doanh\_01.
5. Select **Add a username** .

#### **Create a policy for IAM user account**

To initialize a policy used to access File Storage resources, follow the steps below:

1. Log in to [https://hcm-3.console.vngcloud.vn/iam/](https://hcm-3.console.vngcloud.vn/iam/) with Root User Account.
2. **Select the Policy** folder .
3. Select **Create a Policy** .
4. Enter **Name** and **Description** if given for Policy.
5. Select **Next step** .
6. Select **Product as file-storage** .
7. Select **Actions** :
   1. Select **Allow permissions** : by default, the vIAM system will always be on, which means allowing permissions to be applied to the policy. If you turn this mode off, the system will deny (reverse) the corresponding permissions.
      1. **Allow permissions** : allow access according to the selected action.
      2. **Deny permissions** : deny access according to the selected action.
   2. Select **All file storage actions** if you want to create a policy that has the right to perform all actions on File Storage. For details on the meaning of the actions, please refer to [File Storage Features, Resources and Access Rights.](https://docs-vngcloud-vn.translate.goog/vng-cloud-document/vn/vstorage/filestorage/quan-ly-truy-cap/tinh-nang-tai-nguyen-file-storage-va-quyen-truy-cap)
8. Select **Resources** :
   1. Select **All resources** if you want the access selected above to be allowed to access all resources on your SSO account.
   2. Select **Specify resources** : select the specific storage id file that you want to allow access to. You can enter information for each of these resources in one of the following ways:
      1. **Enter \*** if you want to select all resources.
      2. **Enter the specific ID of the storage file** if you want to point to that exact storage file.
   3. You can also select **Any** to allow access to all file storage in your SSO account.
   4. Select **Request conditions:** enter special conditions for the policy if any.

After you have completed the above 8 steps, the file storage policy has been created. Next, you need to assign it to your IAM User Account.

#### **Attach IAM User Account with corresponding policy**

Once you have created the desired IAM User Account and Policy, you will need to link the IAM User Account to the policy as per the instructions below:

1. Log in to [https://hcm-3.console.vngcloud.vn/iam/](https://hcm-3.console.vngcloud.vn/iam/) with Root User Account.
2. Select the User Account folder **.**
3. Select **the IAM User Account** you want to assign permissions to.
4. Select **Attach policies** .
5. Select the **policies** you want. The vIAM system supports you to assign multiple policies to an IAM User Account. If these policies contain independent permissions, they will complement each other (ie the permission list is merged). On the contrary, if these policies contain conflicting permissions, you will not be able to access the corresponding resources according to this permission list (ie the permission list is merged and when conflicting, they will cancel each other out).
6. Select **Attach** .
