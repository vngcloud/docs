# Charging Fee

File Storage service provides two payment methods to serve different financial goals and strategies of each customer. Two payment methods are deployed for File Storage service at VNG Cloud including:

* Payment Method Prepaid.
* Payment method Pay Later.

## **How to Calculate File Storage Fees** <a href="#cach-tinh-phi-file-storage" id="cach-tinh-phi-file-storage"></a>

* File Storage is charged based on the actual amount of space you use and how long it's stored.
  * If you use less than 1TB per month, the storage will be charged at a minimum of 1TB.
  * If you exceed 1TB, you will be charged based on the actual capacity used.
    * For example:
      * If your Usage is 51 GB, you will need to pay for 1 TB
      * If your Usage is 1.1 TB, you will need to pay 1.1 TB

**File Storage fee is 58.3 VND / 1 GB / 1 day (VAT included)**

In addition, VKS will provide free 50 GB of capacity for the first Public NFS File Storage until December 31, 2024.

### **Prepayment method** <a href="#phuong-thuc-thanh-toan-tra-truoc" id="phuong-thuc-thanh-toan-tra-truoc"></a>

For Prepaid users, VNG Cloud applies Hold Credit to support the use and calculate the cost of File Storage service. Learn more about Hold Credit at [Hold Credit](https://docs.vngcloud.vn/vng-cloud-document/vn/quan-ly-hoa-don-chi-phi-and-tai-nguyen-tren-vng-cloud/trai-nghiem-billing-and-kenh-thanh-toan/ve-billing-and-payment/thanh-toan/tam-giu-credit) .

* **Form** : Under the Credit Hold method, users must maintain a prepaid balance sufficient to cover the service usage in their account.
* **Balance Management** : It is the responsibility of the User to manage their prepaid balance to ensure that it is sufficient to cover the planned use of file storage, and that this balance is sufficient to cover the current and subsequent 3 days of service usage. For details, please refer to [Credit Hold](https://docs.vngcloud.vn/vng-cloud-document/vn/quan-ly-hoa-don-chi-phi-and-tai-nguyen-tren-vng-cloud/trai-nghiem-billing-and-kenh-thanh-toan/ve-billing-and-payment/thanh-toan/tam-giu-credit) .
* **Low balance notification** : To avoid service interruption, the system will send a notification when the prepaid balance drops below a specific threshold, recommending the user to top up. In case the balance is still not guaranteed after being reminded many times, VNG Cloud will temporarily stop providing File storage service to the user.

### **Postpaid Payment Method** <a href="#phuong-thuc-thanh-toan-tra-sau" id="phuong-thuc-thanh-toan-tra-sau"></a>

For postpaid users, VNG Cloud applies the use first - pay later method, similar to other services.

* **Billing Cycle** : Users using the postpaid payment method do not need to maintain a prepaid balance. Instead, File Storage service fees are charged at the end of each monthly billing cycle.
* **Flexibility in using File Storage** : With postpaid billing, users can activate & create file storage as needed without worrying about available balance, providing greater flexibility.
* **Monthly Billing** : File storage service charges are listed on the monthly billing statement, providing users with a clear summary of the costs associated with file storage.
* **Pay on Time** : Paying your monthly bill on time is important to ensure continued access to the file storage service.
* **Usage Tracking** : Users can track their file storage usage through a billing gateway, helping them stay on top of their costs and resource usage.
