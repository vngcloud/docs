## List

<table><thead><tr><th width="123">No.</th><th width="147">Terms</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td><strong>Repository</strong></td><td>This is understood to be the place where backups are stored. A repository can be file systems, network storage systems, or part of a cloud storage service like VNG.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td><strong>Replication</strong></td><td>This is considered the process of backing up data from one location to multiple locations, which helps increase data recovery capabilities.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td><strong>Job</strong></td><td>This is a task configured to perform data backup; a job can be scheduled to run automatically at a specific time or executed manually.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td><strong>Bucket</strong></td><td>This is understood as a container used to store data objects. In Veeam, a Bucket is used to store backup copies in the cloud.</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td><strong>Recovery</strong></td><td>This is the process of restoring data from backups, which can restore files, virtual machines, or specific applications that have been backed up.</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td><strong>Tape</strong></td><td>This refers to tape storage. Veeam allows data backup using tape, which is a traditional storage medium that is cost-effective.</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td><strong>Immutable</strong></td><td>This feature helps protect backup data from being altered or deleted. When data is marked as "immutable," it cannot be changed or deleted for a specified period of time, helping to protect against ransomware attacks or hackers.</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td><strong>Ransomware</strong></td><td>This is malicious software in which hackers encrypt data and demand a ransom to decrypt it. Therefore, Veeam provides data protection by using the Immutable function.</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td><strong>Event log</strong></td><td>This is understood as a record that logs all detailed events occurring within Veeam. The event log helps administrators monitor and troubleshoot issues.</td></tr></tbody></table>
