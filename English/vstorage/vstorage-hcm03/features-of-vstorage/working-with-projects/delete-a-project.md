# Delete a project

You have initiated a project with a suitable storage package. Currently, your business needs have changed, and you no longer require the created project. We encourage you to delete the project to optimize costs.

To delete a project, you can:

&#x20;Use vStorage Portal

1. Log in to [https://vstorage.console.vngcloud.vn](https://vstorage.console.vngcloud.vn/).
2. Select the icon ![](https://docs.vngcloud.vn/download/thumbnails/67994056/image2023-2-2\_16-17-31.png?version=1\&modificationDate=1700552967000\&api=v2) at the project you want to delete. Click **Delete**.
3. Enter the character string **delete me** and click **Delete**.

After you delete the project, the deleted project will disappear from your project list. At this point, the deleted project will be moved to the **Trash**, and your deleted project will be stored in the **Trash** for 7 days at no cost. During these 7 days, you can restore the deleted project. To restore, see Restore project. If you do not restore the project within 7 days, the project along with its data will be permanently deleted from the system and cannot be restored.

When you delete a project before the initial storage period expires, we will reimburse you. Also, when you restore the project, we will charge a restoration fee. For more information on the storage packages we offer, see [Charging Fee](https://docs.vngcloud.vn/display/VSEN/Charging+Fee).

Because deleting a project carries many risks, we recommend careful consideration and creating a backup of the project before proceeding with deletion.

&#x20;Use vStorage API

In addition to the traditional management interface, we also provide APIs that allow you to integrate with your user-facing applications and tools with vStorage for data storage.

To delete a project via the vStorage API, please refer to the [API developers page.](https://docs.vngcloud.vn/display/VSEN/API+developers)
