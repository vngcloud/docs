After selecting Delete, the system will automatically navigate back to the main screen. If you no longer see the object in the list, it means you have successfully deleted it. The object is permanently removed from the system.

Note: Once an object is deleted from the vStorage system, it cannot be recovered.

&#x20;Use vStorage API

In addition to the traditional management interface portal, we also provide APIs that allows you to integrate vStorage with your user-facing applications and tools using for data storage.

To delete an object through the vStorage API, please refer to the [API developers](https://docs.vngcloud.vn/display/VSEN/API+developers).

&#x20;Use 3rd party softwares

vStorage is also compatible with user-side tools using the S3 protocol. You can easily use familiar tools such as Rclone, s3cmd, Cyberduck, and more. Check out 3rd party softwares to learn how to integrate and use these tools.
