# Copy objects

You can also copy objects you have uploaded to different containers. To perform object copying, follow the instructions below:

&#x20;Use vStorage Portal

1\. Log in to [https://vstorage.console.vngcloud.vn](https://vstorage.console.vngcloud.vn/).

2\. Choose the **project**, **container**, and then select the **objects** you want to copy.

3\.

4\. Choose the container and directory, if any, where you want to copy the object. We also support creating a new directory if the desired directory does not exist.

You can copy objects between containers within the same project. Currently, we do not support copying objects between different projects.

&#x20;Use vStorage API

In addition to the traditional management interface, we also provide an API that allows you to integrate your user-facing applications and tools with vStorage for data storage.

To copy objects via vStorage API, please refer to the [API developers](https://docs.vngcloud.vn/display/VSEN/API+developers).

***

&#x20;Use 3rd party softwares

vStorage is also compatible with user-facing tools that use the S3 protocol. You can easily use familiar tools such as Rclone, s3cmd, Cyberduck, and more.

To copy objects via vStorage API, please refer to the [3rd Party Softwares](https://docs.vngcloud.vn/display/VSEN/3rd+Party+Softwares).
