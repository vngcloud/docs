# Working with report

#### Overview <a href="#workingwithreport-overview" id="workingwithreport-overview"></a>

A report is an invaluable tool for monitoring and updating important information, as well as for analyzing, summarizing, and reviewing data, tasks, and activities. The information in reports is used to make crucial decisions that impact your products.

vStorage provides you with statistical reports on the storage and activities of your project. You can view this information for any desired timeframe through various chart formats that we offer.

**Warning:**

* The parameters of each project are aggregated into reports that we compile twice a day at fixed times: 7:00 AM and 12:00 PM. For example, if you create a project, create a container, upload files, or perform PUT/DELETE object actions at 04:00 PM on January 1, 2023, this data will be updated after 12:00 PM on the same day. This means that from January 2, 2023, these parameters will be fully updated in the reports.
* To provide a long-term perspective for your reports, we support the ability to view these reports on a quarterly cycle. For example, you can choose to view report data from January 1, 2023, to March 31, 2023.
