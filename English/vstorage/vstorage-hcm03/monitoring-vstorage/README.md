# Monitoring vStorage

Monitoring is an important part of maintaining the reliability, availability, and performance of vStorage and your storage solutions. We recommend that you collect monitoring data from all vStorage instances so that you can easily troubleshoot problems if they occur. Before you start monitoring vStorage, create a monitoring plan that includes answers to the following questions:

* What are your monitoring goals for vStorage?
* What resources will you monitor on vStorage?
* How often will you monitor these resources on vStorage?
* What monitoring tools will you use?
* Who will perform the monitoring tasks?
* Who should be notified when a problem occurs?
