# Rclone

#### Overview <a href="#rclone-overview" id="rclone-overview"></a>

Rclone is a command-line interface software designed for managing files in cloud computing environments. It serves as a versatile tool that can replace the storage management interface of various cloud service providers, offering a wide range of features. Rclone supports over 40 cloud storage products, including S3 object stores, personal and enterprise file storage services, as well as standard file transfer protocols.

With powerful cloud commands reminiscent of Unix commands such as rsync, cp, mv, mount, ls, ncdu, tree, rm, and cat, Rclone provides a familiar syntax that supports shell pipelines.

To facilitate quick installation and configuration of this user tool, we offer an integration feature through the vStorage Portal. You only need to provide accurate Region, Project, and authentication information (vStorage credentials). Afterward, download the configuration file for Rclone, enabling you to access your resources on the vStorage storage service. Once you have gained access to your resources (project, container, object, etc.) on the vStorage service, you can refer to various use cases or features of Rclone to work with these resources effectively.
