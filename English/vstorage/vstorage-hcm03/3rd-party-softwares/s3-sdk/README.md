# S3 SDK

The vStorage product from VNG Cloud provides an S3 SDK toolkit to facilitate the integration of your software applications with vStorage. The S3 SDK simplifies your programming tasks by encapsulating S3 REST APIs into features in various programming languages. The SDK development toolkit is available for several popular programming languages. Each SDK provides a set of features, sample code, and documentation to help developers build applications more easily using their preferred programming language.

To assist you in quickly installing and configuring this user tool, we provide an integrated feature through the vStorage Portal. You only need to provide accurate Region, Project, and credential information (vStorage credentials), and then download the configuration file for the S3 SDK. You can use this configuration file to access your resources on the vStorage storage service. For more details, refer to \[Integrating S3 SDK with vStorage]. After successfully accessing your resources (project, container, object, etc.) on the vStorage service, you can refer to additional use cases or features of the S3 SDK to work with these resources. For more information, refer to \[Using S3 SDK].
