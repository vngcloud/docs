# S3cmd

S3cmd is a free command-line tool and client designed for uploading, retrieving, and managing data within Amazon S3 and other cloud storage providers using the S3 protocol, such as Google Cloud Storage or DreamHost DreamObjects. S3cmd is suitable for users familiar with command-line software. The tool allows for batch scripting and automatic backups to S3, triggered automatically from cron, and more.

S3cmd is written in the Python programming language. It is an open-source project licensed under the GNU Public License v2 (GPLv2) and is free for both commercial and personal use. Users only need to pay Amazon for their storage services.

To assist with a quick installation and configuration of this user tool, we provide an integration feature through the vStorage Portal. You only need to provide accurate Region, Project, and authentication information (vStorage credentials), and then download the configuration file for S3cmd. You can use this configuration file to access your resources on the vStorage storage service. For details, please refer to [Integrating S3cmd with vStorage](https://docs.vngcloud.vn/display/VSEN/Integrating+S3cmd+with+vStorage). Once you have accessed your resources (project, container, object, etc.) on the vStorage storage service, you can refer to various use cases and features of S3cmd to work with these resources. For details, please refer to [Using S3cmd](https://docs.vngcloud.vn/display/VSEN/Using+S3cmd).
