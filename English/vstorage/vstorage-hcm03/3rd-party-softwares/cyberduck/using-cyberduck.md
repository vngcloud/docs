**Warning:**&#x20;

1. Do not use Cyberduck versions that are too old or too new on operating systems that are too old or too new, as it may result in errors.
2. When using Cyberduck to perform Copy/Move/Rename operations on objects in the vStorage system, it may cause errors. We recommend not using these features.
3. Cyberduck does not support cleaning up incomplete segments when uploading large objects (Multipart upload). When using Cyberduck (s3, swift) to upload a large file (multipart upload), the file is divided into multiple segments to upload to the vStorage system. During the file upload process, some segments may be uploaded, and some may not be uploaded due to errors such as network issues, overloaded vStorage system, your Cyberduck being stopped, hanging, etc. The file is then considered unsuccessfully uploaded, and the uploaded segments are considered incomplete or garbage segments, occupying your storage capacity. Currently, Cyberduck does not support the feature of cleaning up these garbage segments. Therefore, we recommend carefully considering before using this tool.
