# AWS CLI

#### Overview <a href="#awscli-overview" id="awscli-overview"></a>

The AWS CLI is a command-line interface tool that allows users to interact with S3 APIs through commands to perform various features on storage systems that support the S3 protocol. AWS CLI is compatible with the S3 APIs of the vStorage storage service. To view the usage guide for AWS CLI, please refer to the documentation \[here]\([https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/index.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/index.html)).

To integrate the AWS CLI tool, you need to gather information about the Region, Project, and credentials (vStorage credentials). For details, refer to [Integrating AWS CLI with vStorage]. After accessing your resources on the vStorage service (projects, containers, objects, etc.), to work with these resources using the AWS CLI tool, you can explore additional usage scenarios or features of the [Using AWS CLI].
