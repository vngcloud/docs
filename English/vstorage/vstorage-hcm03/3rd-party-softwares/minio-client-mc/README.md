# MinIO Client (MC)

#### Overview <a href="#minioclient-mc-overview" id="minioclient-mc-overview"></a>

MinIO Client is an open-source solution used to set up Object Storage, serving as a highly performant distributed storage server. It facilitates easy uploading, downloading, and manipulation of your data. MinIO Client is compatible with the API of the vStorage storage service. For instructions on using MinIO Client, please refer to the guide of MinIO.

To integrate the MinIO Client tool, you need to gather information about the Region, Project, and authentication details (vStorage credentials). For details, refer to [Integrating MinIO Client with vStorage]. Once you have accessed your resources (project, container, object, etc.) on the vStorage service, you can explore additional use cases and features of MinIO Client to work with your vStorage resources. For more information, see [Using MinIO Client].
