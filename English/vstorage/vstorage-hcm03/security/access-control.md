# Access Control

To ensure the security of access rights to data stored on vStorage, we are using the Identity and Access Management (IAM) service as an authorization solution. The Identity and Access Management (IAM) service is an effective authorization solution to ensure the security of access rights to data stored on vStorage. IAM provides the features and functionality necessary to identify users and their permissions for each resource on vStorage. By using IAM, businesses can ensure that only users with the necessary access can access their data. This helps protect data from unauthorized access.

Here are some of the specific benefits of using IAM to secure data on vStorage:

* **Helps ensure that only users with the necessary access can access data**: IAM allows businesses to create and manage access policies for each vStorage resource. This helps ensure that only users who need access to specific data can access it.
* **Helps prevent unauthorized access to data**: IAM provides strong authentication and authorization features to help prevent unauthorized access to data.
* **Helps reduce the risk of data breaches**: By using IAM, businesses can reduce the risk of data breaches. IAM helps protect data from unauthorized access, which can lead to data breaches.
