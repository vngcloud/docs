# Access Permissions and Working Through Root User Account

To access your resources on the vStorage storage service, you can use various channels such as vStorage Portal, vStorage API, Swift Rest API, S3 Rest API, and Swift/S3 client tools. For vStorage Portal, you use the Root User Account to log in. If you don't have a Root User Account, please refer to the Root User Account.

Follow the steps below to log in to vStorage with the Root User Account:

1\. Access the vStorage service login page: [https://signin.vngcloud.vn](https://signin.vngcloud.vn/).

2\. The main login page will appear. Choose **LOGIN WITH ROOT USER.**

3\. Enter the **email** address and **password** associated with your account and select **Login**. If you've previously logged in as the root user in this browser, your browser may remember the email address for the Root User Account. If so, you will see the screen displayed in the next step. If you have previously logged in as an IAM user using the IAM User Account in this browser, your browser may display the IAM user login page instead. To return to the main login page, choose **LOGIN WITH ROOT USER.**

4\. After successfully logging in, you have full access to and can perform the features provided by the vStorage service on your resources. For details on the features supported by vStorage, please refer to [Features, vStorage Resources, and Access Permissions](https://docs.vngcloud.vn/display/VSEN/Features%2C+vStorage+Resources%2C+and+Access+Permissions).
