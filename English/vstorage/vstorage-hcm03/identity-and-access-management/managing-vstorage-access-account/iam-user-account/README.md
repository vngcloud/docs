# IAM User Account

**IAM User Accounts** are representative accounts used to interact with VNG Cloud through the Portal UI. A user account at VNG includes authentication information (username and password) and is by default set with no access rights. These user accounts do not exist independently; they belong to a single root user account and do not incur any additional fees.

If your business has multiple members who need access to VNG Cloud, it is recommended not to share the security information of the root user account. VNG encourages you to create user accounts for each member under your root user account, allowing you to assign different permissions to each user account.
