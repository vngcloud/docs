# Identity and Access Management

#### Overview <a href="#identityandaccessmanagement-overview" id="identityandaccessmanagement-overview"></a>

VNG Cloud is responsible for safeguarding the fundamental infrastructure of VNG Cloud services, such as data centers and virtualization platforms. VNG Cloud also provides you with services that you can use securely. Among them, access control authorization is one of our top priorities. Access control authorization is a crucial security factor that determines the entities and conditions for accessing specific data, applications, and resources. Access control policies primarily rely on techniques such as authentication and authorization, allowing organizations to clearly verify that users are not being impersonated and are granted appropriate access levels based on user information, roles, and various other factors. The goal of access control is to prevent sensitive information from falling into the hands of malicious actors. Attacks on confidential data can have serious consequences, including intellectual property leakage, exposing the personal information of customers and employees, and even financial losses for the company. Therefore, access control is an integral component of our top-notch security strategy. The list below outlines the best features and tools that we provide for organizations looking to minimize security risks related to unauthorized access to organizational data, especially data stored in the cloud.
