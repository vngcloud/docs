# Resource Quota

vStorage sets resource quotas to ensure that we can provide fast and flexible services to all customers. These resource quotas represent the maximum levels that we recommend, and some resource quotas can be customized based on your storage needs. To submit a request for an increased quota, please visit the VNG Cloud Support Center and create a request.

The tables below list the maximum values for storage resources on your vStorage.

You cannot adjust these quota values.
