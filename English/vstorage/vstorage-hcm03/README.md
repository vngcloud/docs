# Object storage

**Object Storage** (also known as **Object Storage**, **Cloud Storage**) is a form of data storage in discrete units called **objects**. Each object contains the actual data (such as images, videos, files) along with metadata that provides information about the object.

**Benefits of Object Storage:**

* **High durability and availability** due to backup and redundancy features.
* **Rich metadata**: Enhanced data management and retrieval capabilities.
* **Scalability**: Easily expandable without complex reconfiguration or downtime.
* **Cost efficiency**: Often provides lower costs compared to traditional storage solutions, especially for large data storage needs.
