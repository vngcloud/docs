# Step 3: Upload an object

After creating a container in vStorage, you are ready to upload objects to the container. Objects uploaded not only include the original data of the file but also additional metadata providing detailed information about the file. Objects can be of any file type: text, image, video, etc.

1. Log in to [https://vstorage.console.vngcloud.vn](https://vstorage.console.vngcloud.vn/). Choose the **project** and **container** to which you want to upload the object.
2. Select **Upload**.
3. Choose **Select file to upload** or drag the file from your personal device that you want to upload to this area.
4. After dragging or selecting one or more files into this area, click **Upload**.

You have successfully uploaded the object to your container.
