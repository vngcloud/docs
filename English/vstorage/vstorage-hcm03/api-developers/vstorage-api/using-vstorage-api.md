# Using vStorage API

To use vStorage API, you need at least 1 Client ID and Client Secret (this information is obtained from the Service Account). To create a Service Account, refer to the guide at Service Account Creation. You can use this Service Account to create (or delete) multiple containers, where each container acts as a storage unit (similar to a directory). Within each container, users can upload, get, and delete multiple corresponding objects (objects here are understood as files or subfolders within the container).

**Basic process:** Authenticate -> Create project -> Create container -> Upload Object

For a detailed list of vStorage API, refer to [https://docs.api.vngcloud.vn/service-docs/vstorage-api.html#tag/containers](https://docs.api.vngcloud.vn/service-docs/vstorage-api.html#tag/containers).

Below is an example using vStorage API to create a new container in a project:
