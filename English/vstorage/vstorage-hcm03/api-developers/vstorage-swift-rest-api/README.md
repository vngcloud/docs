# vStorage Swift REST API

#### Overview <a href="#vstorageswiftrestapi-overview" id="vstorageswiftrestapi-overview"></a>

Firstly, vStorage is a storage service based on Object Storage architecture. To delve into the details of Object Storage API, please refer to: [https://developer.openstack.org/api-ref/object-store/?expanded=show-account-details-and-list-containers-detail,create-container-detail](https://developer.openstack.org/api-ref/object-store/?expanded=show-account-details-and-list-containers-detail,create-container-detail).

From there, vStorage provides Swift API, enabling companies, organizations, or other users to integrate their user-facing applications and tools with vStorage for storing data such as images, videos, documents, etc. vStorage Swift API includes APIs for working with projects, containers, objects/directories, and more.

Integrating your user-facing applications and tools with vStorage using vStorage Swift API will help you store and manage your data on vStorage. Here's what you can do:

* Retrieve authentication token information.
* Work with containers: initialize containers.
* Work with objects: for example, upload/download/rename/copy/delete objects using tempURL.

To help you easily integrate and quickly experience vStorage Swift REST API, we provide an integration feature through the vStorage Portal. Simply provide accurate information about Region, Project, authentication details (vStorage credentials), and then you can view information and experience vStorage Swift REST API directly on the vStorage Portal. After accessing your resources (projects, containers, objects, etc.) on the vStorage service, to work with these resources using vStorage Swift REST API, you can refer to the documentation \[here]\(provide the actual link).
