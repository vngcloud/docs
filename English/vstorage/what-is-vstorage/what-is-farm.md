# What is Farm?

Farm is a term specific to vStorage. In the context of vStorage, we define a 'farm' as a system comprising infrastructure, services, etc., deployed at a specific location within the two regions: Ha Noi and Ho Chi Minh City. Its purpose is to provide vStorage storage services. Similar to a region, you can choose a farm as the storage location for your data. Choosing the right farm can reduce the load on the system and optimize storage operational costs for your business.
