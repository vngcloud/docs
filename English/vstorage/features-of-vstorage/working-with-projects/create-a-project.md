# Create a project

A Project is a term in vStorage that represents a storage package with a specific capacity that you purchase on VNG Cloud. At any given time, you can own one or more Projects simultaneously and use them to organize resources for different groups or departments with different purposes.

&#x20;Use vStorage Portal

1\. Log in to [https://vstorage.console.vngcloud.vn](https://vstorage.console.vngcloud.vn/).

2\. Choose the **region** where you want to store your data.

Select a region close to you to minimize latency, costs, and address regulatory requirements. Objects stored in a region will never leave that region unless you move them to another region. To see the list of vStorage regions, refer to Resource Limits.

3\. Choose **Create a project**.

The Create New Project screen appears.

4\. In **Project Name**, enter a name that adheres to our guidelines for your project.

Once a project is created, you cannot change its name. For more information on naming projects, see [Project naming rules](https://docs.vngcloud.vn/display/VSEN/Project+naming+rules).

5\. Choose **Project type** based on your storage needs.

We provide three storage packages: Gold, Silver, and Archive, suitable for different data storage requirements. For more information on the storage packages we offer, see [Charging Fee](https://docs.vngcloud.vn/display/VSEN/Charging+Fee).

6\. Choose **Quota** storage based on your needs.

Quota is the maximum storage size you can create. For each storage package, we provide a minimum and maximum size for you to choose from based on your actual needs.

7\. Choose **Create a project.**

8\. Choose **Continue** after reviewing the cart information.

9\. Choose **Payment** after reviewing the cart and payment method.

10\. Choose **Continue** to payment and complete the payment after selecting the appropriate payment method.

To see the list of payment methods for vStorage, refer to Pricing.

After completing the 10 steps described above, the project has been created. Proceed to use the features we provide for the project, starting with Create a container.

&#x20;Use vStorage API

In addition to the traditional management interface portal, we also provide APIs that allow you to integrate vStorage with your user-facing applications and tools for data storage.

To create a new project through the vStorage API, please refer to the [API developers](https://docs.vngcloud.vn/display/VSEN/API+developers).
