# Auto-renew resources - policy & terms

Use this document to learn more about the auto-renewal feature of resources. The document will describe in detail the steps involved in auto-renewing resources and the costs incurred when auto-renewing resources. Other steps will be simplified and only mentioned as part of the process.&#x20;

**The auto-renewal policy for resources only applies to:**&#x20;

* Target: Prepaid users.
* Resource: All resources that allow automatic renewal and are currently in use
* Source of money: VNG Cloud wallet (Credit wallet).

**The auto-renewal process for resources**&#x20;

Auto-renewal of resources is a feature of the system that helps users avoid interruptions when their resources expire (users who need to continue using resources but forget to renew them on the system for some reason).&#x20;

**Users can turn on/off the "Auto-renewal" feature by the following methods:**&#x20;

* Turn on/off at the time of resource creation.
* Turn on/off 3 days before the resource expires&#x20;

**Terms of use for the "Auto-renewal" feature on VNG Cloud are as follows:**&#x20;

* Send an email notification of the resource renewal 7 days before the resource expires.
* The resource is automatically renewed for an additional month from the expiration date.
* Users need to have enough available credit balance as notified by the system for the renewal to proceed.
* The system officially performs the renewal 3 days before the resource expires.
  * The price calculation when the system automatically renews is no different from when users manually renew resources, see more details here.
  * The system sends information about the resources that have been successfully/failed to be renewed to the user.
  * The system generates a corresponding invoice for the extended period.
* Auto-renewal does not apply to resources that have already expired. This means that when auto-renewal is enabled, but the automatic renewal process fails due to a lack of credit, resulting in the resource expiring, users need to take proactive steps to restore the resource to continue using the service.
