# Resource POC

The POC resource is created to support users to experience the services at VNG Cloud in the best way possible.&#x20;

**Conditions for using POC resources:**&#x20;

* Target: Users who are granted POC wallets.
* Source of money: POC wallets.
* Resources: All resources applicable to PO.
* &#x20;Usage time: Depends on the time limit of the granted POC wallet.&#x20;

## Initializing POC resources&#x20;

* Step 1: Configure resources&#x20;
  * 1.1 Access the vServer, vStorage, vMonitor product page.
  * 1.2 Select the resources and configuration to use on the product page.
  * 1.3 Click to use POC resources.
  * 1.4 Confirm the use of resources to proceed to payment: At this point, the system will redirect users to the resource payment page.
* Step 2: Pay for resources using POC wallet -> See detailed instructions here.
* Step 3: System Implementation&#x20;
  * Provide resources.
  * Email notification of newly created resource information.

**Some notes when initializing POC resources**&#x20;

* The default usage time of POC resources is the same as the end time of the POC wallet.
* POC wallets can only be used to pay for POC resources.
* For POC resources, the system will not generate corresponding resource invoices.
* The pricing method for using POC resources is similar to regular resources. See details here&#x20;

## Changing the configuration of POC resources

The pricing process and methods are similar to when changing configurations when using regular resources. See details here.

## Renewing POC resources

In case the usage time of the user's POC wallet is extended after POC resources have been initialized, the user can proceed to extend the corresponding POC resources with the new end time of the wallet. The pricing process and methods are similar to when extending regular resources. See details here.

## Stopping POC for POC resources&#x20;

In case the user stops POC before the end of the POC resource usage time, the system will:&#x20;

* Refund the remaining POC resource usage fee (if any) to the POC wallet.

To continue using the stopped POC resources as a regular resource (for the purpose of maintaining the configuration), users can:&#x20;

* Renew the resources (in case the resources have not been moved to the trash).
* Recover resources (in case the resources have been moved to the trash within 7 days).

For both tasks above, resources will not be considered regular resources and users must proceed to pay for resource usage fees through other forms besides POC wallets.

## POC wallet expiration&#x20;

At the expiration of the POC wallet, the system will:&#x20;

* Stop POC for all resources currently in use: The processing procedure is similar to when users actively stop POC on resources.&#x20;
* Disable POC wallet: Users will not be allowed to use resources in the form of POC until the POC wallet is enabled again.
