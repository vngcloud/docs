Users can only recover resources when:&#x20;

The resource has expired for no more than n days and has been moved to the trash before being permanently deleted: Depending on the regulations of each product, resources may exist in the trash for 3 or 7 days. The resource has been deleted (by the user or the system) and has been moved to the trash within 7 days before being permanently deleted: Depending on the processing mechanism of each product, resources may be permanently deleted or moved to the trash when the user actively deletes the resource.&#x20;

**Why do we need to recover resources?**&#x20;

Basically, recovering expired resources is similar to creating new resources.&#x20;

However, when recovering expired resources, users can skip the step of selecting resource configurations because the system will default to retaining the previous configuration of the resource before expiration. This helps to speed up the resource creation process compared to having to reconfigure from scratch.
