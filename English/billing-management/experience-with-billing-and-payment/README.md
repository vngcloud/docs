# Experience with Billing & Payment

Use this guide to get started with the **Billing & Payment system**. You will have an overview of the main features that the system is processing, thereby understanding more about the system's behavior on each resource/service.&#x20;

Here, we divide the system into 3 main functional groups:&#x20;

* **Payment:** Processing tasks related to Resource payment, Bill payment, Linking payment gateway outside VNG Cloud wallet, etc.&#x20;
* **Invoice management:** Recording user actions on resources, thereby recording new invoices for the corresponding resources on each specific action (creating new, changing configurations, renewing, etc.)&#x20;
* **Resource lifecycle management:** Effectively controlling the resource lifecycle and notifying users of expiring resources, automatic renewal,... helping users make timely decisions to ensure a seamless resource usage experience.
