# Kube Reserved

Kube Reserved helps VKS protect system components on each worker node by reserving a portion of CPU and memory upfront — preventing user workloads from consuming all resources and pushing the node into a **NotReady** state.

---

## Overview

Each worker node in a VKS cluster runs two groups of components alongside user workloads:

**Group 1 — System processes running directly on the node OS** (outside the Pod runtime):
- kubelet
- container runtime (containerd)
- OS daemon (systemd, sshd, log agent…)

**Group 2 — System pods running in the `kube-system` namespace** (including DaemonSets and Deployments):
- kube-proxy
- CNI agent
- CoreDNS
- CSI controller
- Load Balancer controller

These two groups draw resources from two separate resource pools:

| Group | Resource pool |
|---|---|
| System processes | **Reserved** |
| System pods | **Allocatable** |

```
Node Capacity (vCPU / RAM)
┌──────────────────────┬──────────────────────────────┐
│  kube-reserved       │  Allocatable                 │
│  ├ kubelet           │  ├ User Pods                 │
│  ├ containerd        │  └ kube-system Pods          │
│  └ OS daemon         │    (CoreDNS, CNI, CSI...)    │
└──────────────────────┴──────────────────────────────┘
         ↑                           ↑
   Protects system            kube-scheduler
   processes                  schedules here
```

**Problem:** If all node capacity is allocated to Pods, Group 1 system processes may run out of resources during a workload spike, leading to common failure modes:

- Node transitions to **NotReady** state
- kubelet / containerd is **OOM killed**
- Node becomes unresponsive

**Solution:** VKS **reserves** a portion of CPU and memory for Group 1 at provisioning time. The remainder is allocated to:

- User workload (your Pods)
- Group 2 system pods

**Formula:** In `kubectl describe node` output, the `Allocatable` value is calculated as:

```
Allocatable = Capacity − Reserved − Eviction threshold
```

## How VKS calculates reserved resources

VKS applies a **tiered model with decreasing rates** (progressive tiering): the larger the node, the lower the **reserve ratio**, because system overhead grows more slowly than total node capacity.

### CPU reserved

Tiers are accumulated and added to a fixed **100m baseline**:

| CPU tier | Reserve rate |
|---|---|
| Core 1 | 6% |
| Core 2 | 1% |
| Cores 3 – 4 | 0.5% |
| Core 5 and above | 0.25% |

### Memory reserved

Tiers are accumulated and added to a fixed **200 MiB baseline**:

| RAM tier | Reserve rate |
|---|---|
| 0 – 4 GiB | 25% |
| 4 – 8 GiB | 20% |
| 8 – 16 GiB | 10% |
| 16 – 128 GiB | 6% |
| Above 128 GiB | 2% |

## How it is applied on the node

VKS injects the reserved parameters into the kubelet flag at node join time (via bootstrap config). Key behaviors:

- The `kube-reserved` value is **subtracted directly from Allocatable** — kube-scheduler never schedules user Pods into this portion.
- VKS does **not configure `system-reserved`** separately. Resources for OS daemons are protected indirectly through the kubelet's default **eviction threshold**.
- VKS uses `enforce-node-allocatable=pods` (default upstream): kubelet only creates a cgroup hard-limit for **kubepods**; system processes are **not bound** to a dedicated cgroup.
- The reserved amount is calculated from the node group's Flavor at provisioning time and is **immutable for the entire lifecycle of the node group**. To apply a different Flavor, you need to provision a new node group with the desired Flavor, migrate workloads, then delete the old node group.

## Examples

### Flavor `2 vCPU / 4 GiB`

**CPU reserved:**
```
100m (baseline)
+ 1000m × 6%    = 60m   (core 1)
+ 1000m × 1%    = 10m   (core 2)
─────────────────────────
= 170m
```

**Memory reserved:**
```
200 MiB (baseline)
+ 4096 MiB × 25% = 1024 MiB
─────────────────────────
= 1224 MiB
```

→ Kubelet flag: `--kube-reserved=cpu=170m,memory=1224Mi`  
→ **Allocatable for Pods ≈ 1830m CPU / 2872 MiB RAM**

### Flavor `4 vCPU / 8 GiB`

- **CPU:** `100 + 60 + 10 + 2000×0.5% = 180m`
- **RAM:** `200 + 4096×25% + 4096×20% = 200 + 1024 + 819.2 ≈ 2044 MiB`

→ `--kube-reserved=cpu=180m,memory=2044Mi`

### Flavor `8 vCPU / 16 GiB`

- **CPU:** `100 + 60 + 10 + 10 + 4000×0.25% = 190m`
- **RAM:** `200 + 1024 + 819.2 + 8192×10% = 2863 MiB`

→ `--kube-reserved=cpu=190m,memory=2863Mi`

### Flavor `16 vCPU / 32 GiB`

- **CPU:** `100 + 60 + 10 + 10 + 12000×0.25% = 210m`
- **RAM:** `200 + 1024 + 819.2 + 819.2 + 16384×6% ≈ 3846 MiB`

→ `--kube-reserved=cpu=210m,memory=3846Mi`

## Quick reference table

| Flavor | CPU reserved | RAM reserved | CPU overhead ratio | RAM overhead ratio |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2c / 4 GiB | 170m | 1224 MiB | ~8.5% | ~30% |
| 4c / 8 GiB | 180m | 2044 MiB | ~4.5% | ~25% |
| 8c / 16 GiB | 190m | 2863 MiB | ~2.4% | ~17% |
| 16c / 32 GiB | 210m | 3846 MiB | ~1.3% | ~12% |
| 32c / 64 GiB | 250m | 5810 MiB | ~0.8% | ~9% |

{% hint style="info" %}
**Best practice:** The larger the node, the higher the workload utilization. For production workloads that need to maximize resource efficiency, prefer **fewer larger nodes** over **many small nodes**.

## Verify on your cluster

### View the running kubelet configuration

```bash
kubectl get --raw "/api/v1/nodes/<node-name>/proxy/configz" \
  | jq '.kubeletconfig | {kubeReserved, systemReserved, enforceNodeAllocatable, evictionHard}'
```

Sample output on a VKS node:

```json
{
  "kubeReserved": { "cpu": "180m", "memory": "2044Mi" },
  "systemReserved": null,
  "enforceNodeAllocatable": ["pods"],
  "evictionHard": { "memory.available": "100Mi", "nodefs.available": "10%" }
}
```

### Compare Capacity and Allocatable

```bash
kubectl describe node <node-name>
```

```
Capacity:
  cpu:     4
  memory:  8Gi
Allocatable:
  cpu:     3820m       ← Capacity − kube-reserved − eviction-threshold
  memory:  ~6Gi
```

The gap between `Capacity` and `Allocatable` equals `kube-reserved + eviction-threshold`.

### Observe system process resource consumption

To observe the actual resource consumption of system processes protected by `kube-reserved` (kubelet, containerd, OS daemon), SSH into the node and inspect cgroups:

```bash
systemd-cgtop
systemctl status kubelet containerd
```

## FAQ

**Can I override the reserved amounts for my node?**  
No. VKS manages the kubelet config to ensure node stability. Reserved is calculated automatically from the node group's Flavor and is not user-configurable.

**Why do smaller Flavors have a higher RAM overhead ratio?**  
Because system components have a fixed overhead (~200 MiB baseline). On a 4 GiB node, this baseline is a significant fraction of total memory, but on a 64 GiB node it is negligible. This is why production environments should use larger Flavors to optimize utilization.

**Can reserved amounts change at runtime?**  
No. Reserved is set at node join time and is immutable for the entire node lifecycle.

**Can I change the Flavor of my current node group to reduce overhead?**  
Node group Flavor is immutable for the lifetime of the node group. If you need a larger Flavor to reduce the overhead ratio, **provision a new node group** with the desired Flavor → migrate workloads → decommission the old node group.

**Why is Allocatable slightly smaller than `Capacity − kube-reserved`?**  
Allocatable also subtracts the **eviction threshold** (default `memory.available<100Mi`) — a buffer that gives kubelet time to evict Pods before the node runs out of memory. Full formula: `Allocatable = Capacity − kube-reserved − eviction-threshold`.
