# Whitelist

#### O**verview** <a href="#tong-quan" id="tong-quan"></a>

The IP Whitelist feature on VKS's Private Node Group mode allows you to only allow specific IP addresses to connect to your Cluster. This helps increase security for applications and sensitive data by restricting access from unknown sources.

**Benefit**

* **Enhanced security:** IP Whitelist helps protect your data and applications from potential threats on public networks, such as cyberattacks and data breaches.
* **Minimize risk:** By restricting access to sensitive nodes, Whitelist IP helps minimize the risk of spreading a data breach to other parts of your network.
* **Greater control:** Whitelist IP allows you to tightly control access to your nodes, ensuring only authorized users and applications can access.

**Recommendations for Using Whitelist in Cluster Models:**

**1. Public Cluster Only Includes Public Node Group**

* **Recommendation** : Not recommended to use whitelist.
*   If you need to use Whitelist IP for security, please allow vServer's IP Range Public list according to the following list:
