# Charging Fee

For the Procuracy, **the Managed Control Plane cost is completely free.** You only need to pay for other resources that you actually use, including:

* All nodes present in the Cluster (VM). Details on how to calculate the price of vServer can be found [here](https://docs-vngcloud-vn.translate.goog/vng-cloud-document/v/vn/vserver/compute-hcm03-1a/cach-tinh-gia-vserver) .
* Load Balancer is integrated into your Cluster. Details on how to calculate the price of Load Balancer can be found [here](https://docs-vngcloud-vn.translate.goog/vng-cloud-document/v/vn/vserver/compute-hcm03-1a/cach-tinh-gia-vserver) .
* Persistent Volume, Snapshot integrated into your Cluster. Details on how to calculate Volume prices can be found [here](https://docs-vngcloud-vn.translate.goog/vng-cloud-document/v/vn/vserver/compute-hcm03-1a/cach-tinh-gia-vserver) .

**Attention:**

* To ensure your Cluster operates stably, we have automatically set up Auto-renew for all resources on your Cluster. Before the expiration date of the resources, make sure your credit balance is enough for the system to auto-renew successfully.
