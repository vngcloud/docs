# Release notes

## Oct 03, 2024 <a href="#april_19_2024-3" id="april_19_2024-3"></a>

VKS (VNGCloud Kubernetes Service) has just released its latest update, bringing many features and improvements to users. Here are the highlights of the update:

**New Region:**

* In addition to Region HCM03, VKS now supports Region HAN01. This addition gives customers more options in deploying applications, especially useful for businesses with data location requirements.

**New features:**

* **Network Type: Cilium Overlay, Cilium VPC Native Routing:** In addition to Calico Overlay, this release we have added two new network types: Cilium Overlay and Cilium VPC Native Routing. Cilium Overlay allows you to build flexible overlay networks, while Cilium VPC Native Routing integrates tightly with VNG Cloud's VPC, optimizing performance and security for your applications. For more details, please refer [here](https://docs-vngcloud-vn.translate.goog/vng-cloud-document/vn/vks/network/cni) .

**Improve:**

* **Multiple Subnets for Clusters on VKS:** VKS now supports using multiple subnets for a cluster. This allows you to configure each node group in the cluster to be located on different subnets within the same VPC, optimizing resource allocation and network management.
* **Edit Labels/Taints on an existing VKS cluster:** With the ability to directly edit Labels/Taints on a deployed VKS cluster, you can control Pod scheduling, apply different policies to Node Groups, and customize node selection rules for applications. This helps manage and classify resources more efficiently.
* **Enable/Disable Private Service Endpoint usage option:** Previously, when creating a private cluster on VKS, creating a private service endpoint was required. Now, you can easily enable/disable this feature, allowing services in the VKS cluster to communicate via internal IP addresses, enhancing security and minimizing the risk of external attacks.
* **Enable/Disable Volume Encryption Option:** Volume encryption feature allows you to protect sensitive data stored in the Persistent Volumes of the VKS cluster. This ensures data security and compliance with information protection regulations. Now, you can enable/disable encryption for each Volume as needed.

VKS (VNGCloud Kubernetes Service) introduces the latest update to the existing VKS, bringing many new features to users. Here are the details about the update:

**New features:**

* **Private Cluster**: Previously, public clusters on VKS were using Public IP addresses to communicate between nodes and the control plane. To improve the security of your cluster, we have launched the private cluster model. The Private Cluster feature helps your K8S cluster to be as secure as possible, all connections are completely private from the connection between the nodes to the control plane, the connection from the client to the control plane, or the connection from the nodes to other products and services in VNG Cloud such as: vStorage, vCR, vMonitor, VNGCloud APIs,... **Private Cluster is the ideal choice for services that require strict access control, ensuring compliance with regulations on security and data privacy**. For details on the two operating models of Cluster, you can refer to [here ](../mo-hinh-hoat-dong.md)and refer to the steps to create a private Cluster [here](https://docs-vngcloud-vn.translate.goog/vng-cloud-document/v/vn/vks/bat-dau-voi-vks/khoi-tao-mot-private-cluster) .

VKS (VNGCloud Kubernetes Service) introduces the latest update to the already available VKS, bringing many new features and improvements to users. Here are the details about the update:

**New feature:**

* **Stop POC support for Cluster** : Users can now easily perform Stop POC for all resources being POC on a Cluster, instead of having to perform Stop POC individually for each resource. This helps save time and effort when moving Cluster from test resources to real resources. For more details, refer [here](https://docs-vngcloud-vn.translate.goog/vng-cloud-document/v/vn/vks/clusters/stop-poc) .

**Improve:**

* **Node Group status : Added " Degraded** " status so users can monitor the operating status of the Node Group more accurately. This status will display when the number of active nodes is less than the actual number of replicas.
* **Timeout for Cluster and Node Group** : Added timeout for Cluster and Node Group creation, this improvement ensures VKS operates smoothly and efficiently, while providing clear and timely information to users. use. Timeout for Cluster creation is **1 hour** and for Node Group is **3 hours** . If after this time your Cluster or Node Group has not been successfully created, we will update their status to ERROR. At this point, you can delete and create another Cluster or Node Group instead.
* **KubeConfig Access:** Access to the KubeConfig file is now only allowed when the Cluster is Active. This improvement helps users avoid configuration errors when using Terraform to automate Kubernetes deployments.

We are extremely pleased to announce that the official release ( **General Availability** ) of VNGCloud Kubernetes Service is available. With this official release, in addition to the features we have provided on previous releases, this version will bring many new features and improvements to users. Here are the details about the update:

**New feature:**

* **Re-activate:** VKS allows you to request the system to automatically re-initialize the default IAM Service Account when you mistakenly delete or change previously created default IAM Service Account information. The default IAM Service Account is the IAM Service Account that is automatically created by the VKS system when you start working with VKS. We will use this IAM Service Account to initialize resources for your Cluster.
* **Event History** : VKS will display the history of events that occur when users work with the Cluster or each Node Group. This will be a way to help you monitor activities occurring with your Cluster, thereby limiting unusual activities from occurring.
* **Volume** : VKS has integrated the display of the Volume list at the Resource Tab, helping you easily manage the Volumes that are attached to your Cluster.
* **Load Balancer** : VKS has integrated the display of the Load Balancer list in the Resource Tab, helping you easily manage the Load Balancers being used for your Cluster.

**Improve:**

* **Performance** : VKS has optimized performance when initializing the Cluster. Specifically, in the Alpha version, the time from the start of Cluster initialization (with Default Node Group) to the time the Cluster switches to **ACTIVE** state is about 04:00s to 04:30s. Currently, this time has been optimized by us to **02:30s to 03:00s** depending on each Cluster and each time you initialize.
* **Garbage collection of unused containers and images** : VKS will automatically delete unused images when the disk reaches the usage limit (usage/quota ratio >= 85%).
* **In addition** , this GA version has improved a few other issues such as:
  * Changing **the Node Name** helps you easily use and manage your Cluster. Specifically, the Node Name will have additional information: **Cluster Name** , **Node Group Name** .
  * Delete **User Builder** on User's Worker Node.
  * **Change SSH** mechanism from Port 22 to Port 234.

If you encounter any problems with this official release, please contact VKS support for assistance.
