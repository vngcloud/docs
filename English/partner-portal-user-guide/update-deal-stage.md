# Update Deal Stage

**Partners are responsible for updating the deal stage information so VNG Cloud can monitor the deal and ensure the partner's benefits in executing the deal.**

**Step 1:** Go to the "**Deal**" menu.

**Step 2:** On the deal list screen, select the deal you want to view details .

**Step 3:** Update the deal status.

* Partners can update deal information by selecting the options to:
  * Update the deal stage. Click on “**Update Stage**” and the partner can choose the new stage of the deal. In the case where the stage is "**Won Deal**" or "**Lost Dea**l" the system will automatically close the deal.
  * For a "**Won Deal**" stage, a discount with the registered rate in the deal will automatically be generated for the partner and applied according to the partner agreement with VNG Cloud. Additionally, the customer registered by the partner in the deal will become the partner’s customer.
  * Check the deal’s discount in the “**Discount**” menu.
  * The partner is responsible for creating a discount for their customer so the customer can enjoy the discount rate as committed by the partner in the deal.
  * For a "**Lost Deal**" stage, the deal will be closed and the registered discount will not be executed.
* Partners can also add file attachments, such as BOM, to show the deal's progress:
  * Select the file to add and click "**Add Files**"
* Or add a note in the “**Add a Comment**” section to update the current status of the deal's progress:
  * Enter the note and click “**Add a Comment**” to complete.
