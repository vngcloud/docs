# View Customer Discount by Deal

**Step 1:** Partner navigates to the "Accounts" menu.&#x20;

**Step 2:** Find and select the customer whose deal discount details need to be viewed. Customers under a deal will have the deal name listed in the "**Account Name**" column in the details row.&#x20;

* Enter the search criteria for the customer account you want to view.&#x20;
* Click on the hyperlink at the account name to view details and navigate to the detailed screen.&#x20;
* View discount information under the "**Current Discount**" section on the detailed screen.
