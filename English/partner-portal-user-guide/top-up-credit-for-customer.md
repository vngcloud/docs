# Top up Credit for Customer

* For partner’s customers, adding credits directly is not permitted. To be able to buy VNG Cloud’s services, partners will top up credits for customers based on specific requirements from them.
* Topping up credits will be done by transferring credits from partner account to customer account. Once the transaction is completed, the system will subtract those credits from partner account and add them to customer account.

**Step 1:** Select the "**Account**" menu.

**Step 2:** Choose the customer account you want to add credit to.

* Find and select the account you want to add credit to. The customer account must have the status "**Active**"
* Click on hyperlink at the customer's name to access the detailed customer information screen.

**Step 3:** Top up credit.

* Select the "**Top Up**" function and enter the amount of credit you want to add for the customer.
* Click "**Top Up**" if you are sure you want to transfer credit to the selected customer.
* Click "**Cancel**" if you want to change your decision.
