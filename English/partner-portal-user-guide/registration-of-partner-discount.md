# Registration of Partner Discount

* Partner discount is an amount of discount VNG Cloud offers partners in order to expand service distribution channel.
* Partners can use this function on partner portal to register the desired amount of discount, after being approved by VNG Cloud, partners will be able to apply it when a customer order is created at the time the discount is in “Active” status.

**Step 1:** Select the "Partner Discounts" menu.

**Step 2:** Register a Discount

* Select "**Register Discount**" and enter the desired discount percentage for each product. For products without an entered discount, the system will understand that the user does not require a discount for those products.
* The effective date of the discount must be more than 3 days from the current date.
* After clicking "**Register**," the newly created discount will change to "**Awaiting Approval**" status, and the user will receive an email notification that the discount registration is being reviewed by VNG Cloud.
* Within 3 working days, VNG Cloud will review and either approve or reject the registered discount. The status of the discount will be updated on this screen once VNG Cloud confirms it.
* If VNG Cloud approves the registered discount, the status will change to "**Awaiting Active**"
* For discounts with "**Awaiting Active**" status, when the effective date arrives, the status will change from "**Awaiting Active**" to "**Awaiting Active**."
* For discounts with "**Active**" status, when a new discount changes status from "**Awaiting Active**" to "**Active**," the current discount will be marked as "**Expired**."

**Notes:**

* If the VNG Cloud approval date is later than the user-entered discount effective date, the discount effective date will be updated to the approval date.
* The Partner's discount is applied when a new customer order is created within the discount period.
* At any given time, only one discount can be in "**Active**" status and one discount in "**Awaiting Approval**" status.
* When a new discount changes status from "**Awaiting Active**" to "**Active**", the current discount will be marked as "**Expired**."
