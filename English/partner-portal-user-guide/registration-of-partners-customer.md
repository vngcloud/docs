# Registration of Partner's Customer

Partners can complete customer registration process on VNG Cloud portal for the purpose of:

* Officially confirm the agency’s customer (after confirmation from VNG Cloud).
* Manage customer credits and price lists.
* Manage revenue according to customer registration

**Step 1:** Select the "**Account**" menu.

**Step 2:** Register a Customer Account

* Select the "**Add a Customer account**" function.
* Enter the required information:
  * **Email Address**: Customer's email address.
  * **Friendly Name**: Common name of the customer, for easy management by the user.
  * **Your Role**: The partner’s role for this customer. The system defaults to "Partner" to distinguish from other roles within the system.
* Click "**Add**" to add the customer to the system.

When a customer is successfully added on the Partner portal, a request will be sent to the registered customer’s email for confirmation to become the partner’s customer. After the customer’s confirmation, the request will be sent to VNG Cloud for approval, provided the customer is not already a VNG Cloud customer. Once the Partner’s customer is approved by VNG Cloud, the status will be updated to "**Active**"
